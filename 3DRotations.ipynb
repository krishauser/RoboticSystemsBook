    "to translations, rotations behave in a fundamentally different fashion\n",
    "than translations. To get a better understanding of rotations, we will\n",
    "first introduce little bit of *topology*, a branch of mathematics that\n",

    "are preserved under arbitrary invertible transformations, and hence they\n",
    "are fundamental characteristics of the spaces themselves, and not simply\n",
    "their coordinate representations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by introducing topological concepts in terms of the space\n",
    "of 2D rotations SO(2). The immediate concern that one may have about 2D\n",
    "rotations is that angles \"wrap around\", so that the direction at\n",
    "$0^\\circ$ is identical to $360^\\circ$ or any multiple thereof. This is\n",
    "an important issue in many contexts:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   For a robot to rotate from a heading of $30^\\circ$ to $330^\\circ$,\n",

    "    modulo $360^\\circ$: to estimate absolute position using external\n",
    "    means, the history of all the joint's movements must be remembered.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   When retrieving items from a table (of control commands or motions,\n",

    "    the closest item in terms of absolute angular deviation modulo\n",
    "    $360^\\circ$ rather than simply taking the absolute difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there is a one-to-one mapping between each element of SO(2) and\n",

    "$x(s) : [0,1] \\rightarrow \\mathcal{X}$. Two spaces are topologically\n",
    "equivalent if there exists a bijection between them that preserves path\n",
    "continuity. Such a bijection is called a *homeomorphism*, and\n",
    "topologically equivalent spaces called *homeomorphic*. If there exists\n",
    "no such bijection, they are topologically distinct (not homeomorphic).\n",
    "\n",
    "Since any mapping between SO(2) and $[0,2\\pi)$ breaks the continuity of\n",
    "paths through the 0 angle, they are topologically distinct. It can be\n",
    "shown, however, that SO(2) is homeomorphic to the unit circle $S_1$. The\n",
    "function mapping an angle $\\theta$ to the point\n",
    "$(\\cos \\theta, \\sin \\theta)$ on the circle (i.e., the direction vector\n",
    "with heading $\\theta$) is a bijection. The inverse mapping is an\n",
    "operation known as the *argument* of the point, and is similar to\n",
    "$\\tan^{-1} (y/x)$ but respect the quadrant of each point $(x,y)$ and\n",
    "also handles the case where $x=0$. (In many programming languages this\n",

    "bijection preserves the continuity of paths through both SO(2) and\n",
    "$S_1$: continuous paths on SO(2) map to continuous paths on $S_1$ and\n",
    "vice versa, even if they pass through the 0 angle.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, rotational motion is fundamentally similar to motion on a\n",

    "## Representing elements of topological spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common topological spaces we discuss in robotics include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $\\mathbb{R}^n$: Cartesian space of $n$ dimensions\n",
    "\n",
    "- $SO(n)$: The special orthogonal group in $n$ dimensions.  This is defined as the set of $n \\times n$ orthogonal matrices with determinant +1.  As we have seen before, SO(2) is the space of 2D rotations, and SO(3) is the space of 3D rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $SE(n)$: The special Euclidean group in $n$ dimensions.  This is the set of all rigid transformations in dimension $n$, and is equivalent to $SO(n) \\times \\mathbb{R}^n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $S_n$: the $n$-dimensional sphere.  $S_1$ is the circle, and $S_2$ is the standard sphere.   It is important to note that this space denotes the _surface_ of the sphere, and $n$ is the _intrinsic dimensionality_ of the surface, even though we typically embed $S_1$ in a 2D plane, and $S_2$ in a 3D space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to compose multiple spaces with the Cartesian product, such as $S_1 \\times S_1$, which is the topology of the torus.  We also use a power notation $S_1 \\times S_1 = S_1^2$ to denote repeated applications of the Cartesian product.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we usually use a vector of parameters to describe elements of these spaces, this representation (in $\\mathbb{R}^n$) does not capture their connectivity perfectly.  The vector representation will have deficiencies in having double representations of the same object, infinite representations of the same object (singularities), and in interpolation, which may not produce geodesics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first consider a simpler example that will illustrate several of the issues we will come across when representing 3D rotations.  The latitude and longitude representation of the unit sphere (spherical coordinates), where each point has coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{x}(\\theta,\\phi) = \\begin{bmatrix} \\cos \\theta \\cos \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\theta \\cos \\phi \\\\ \\sin \\phi \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "Here $\\theta \\in [0,2\\pi)$ gives the longitude and $\\phi \\in [-\\pi/2,\\pi/2]$ gives the latitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since each point on the sphere can be represented by some $(\\theta,\\phi)$ pair, this shows that the inherent dimensionality of $S_2$ is no more than 2.\n",
    "However, there are two singularities of this representation, namely, the north and south poles (0,0,1) and (0,0,-1), in which a point on the sphere have an infinite number of 2D representations. $\\mathbf{x}(\\theta,\\pi/2) = (0,0,1)$  for any value of $\\theta$, and $\\mathbf{x}(\\theta,-\\pi/2) = (0,0,-1)$ for any value of $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nonlinearity in this mapping also means that as a point approaches and passes either pole, the representation of the point swings wildly.  If $\\mathbf{x} = (x,y,z)$, we have the inverse relation $\\phi = \\sin^{-1} z$, and $\\theta = atan2(y,x)$ (which is undefined for $x=y=0$).  Observe the $\\theta$ variable in the following plot as the arc gets closer to passing through the pole (blue and black curves):\n"

    "Another limitation of this representation is that interpolation is not as straightforward as simply blending between two points.  Suppose two points $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ on the sphere are represented by spherical coordinates $(\\theta_a,\\phi_a)$ and $(\\theta_b,\\phi_b)$, respectively.  In general, the straight line path from $(\\theta_a,\\phi_a)$ and $(\\theta_b,\\phi_b)$ does not map to the shortest line between $\\mathbf{a}$ and $\\mathbf{b}$ on the sphere.  First of all, the connectivity between 0 and $2\\pi$ in the $\\theta$ dimension (that is, the topology of SO(2) in the domain of $\\theta$) needs to be taken into account.  But even with that handled properly, these straight line paths are still not the shortest paths on the sphere &mdash; in other words, straight line interpolation in the representation space does not produce geodesic paths on the sphere.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have observed this phenomenon if you have ever taken an intercontinental flight between two destinations somewhat north of the equator. For example, the flight path from New York to London, when seen on a traditional map, is actually a curve that arcs above the straight line path from New York to London.  An even more extreme example is when flying from New York to Beijing: the flight path actually passes close to the North Pole!  Airlines are extremely sensitive to fuel usage, so they prefer to travel around the Earth along minimum length paths.  The mathematical solution to this problem is to interpolate along _great circles_, which are geodesics on the sphere.  Solving for and proving optimality of geodesics is of great interest, and as we shall see below, luckily there are closed-form solutions for geodesics in SO(3) as well."

    "1.  Derive a method to compute the \"average\" of two angles in SO(2).\n",

    "    is the notion of average ill-defined?\n",

    "3.  Explain why the 3D rotation about the Y axis has the signs of its\n",
    "    off-diagonal $\\sin \\theta$ terms in the opposite orientation as the\n",
    "    X and Z rotations.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Give an example of an Euler angle representation for which direct\n",
    "    interpolation produces a path of rotations that is very unlike a\n",
    "    geodesic in SO(3).\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Symbolically, derive the function that maps a ZYZ Euler angle\n",
    "    representation to a $3\\times 3$ rotation matrix. Now, compute its\n",
    "    inverse (that is, a procedure for mapping a rotation matrix to a ZYZ\n",
    "    Euler angle representation). Where are the singularities of this\n",
    "    representation?\n",

    "6.  Derive a method to compute the average of two 3D rotation matrices.\n",
