If you see stray code like `= \\begin{equation}` etc, this is a [known rendering problem](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/2865) with multiple matrices.  It seems like this problem is more prevalent in static HTML and Colab; try opening the book in a native Jupyter Notebook or on Binder if these rendering issues prevent you from understanding the equation."
