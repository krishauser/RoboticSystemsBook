    "Bug algorithms are simple, clever planning methods that do not actually need a map of obstacles to work!  The only pieces of information needed on-board the robot are 1) a way to determine the robot's current location $X$ and goal location $G$, 2) a contact sensor, and 3) a bit of memory.  By studying how the robot would behave in certain maps, this give us a sense of how to analyze the performance of planners. \n",
    "\n",
    "The inspiration for bug algorithms comes from the _right-hand rule_ for solving mazes. If you are in a maze, a sure-fire way not to get lost is to find a wall, face a direction so that the wall is on your right, and walk along the wall while keeping it immediately to your right.  By following this process, only two possibilities may result: 1) you exit the maze, or 2) you return to the point at which you first touched the wall.  If you return to the starting point, the wall makes a closed circuit, so the next step should be to find a new portion of wall that you did not touch, and apply the right-hand rule again for that new wall.  Using this approach, you are guaranteed to explore the entire maze.  (There is no significance to right vs left; you can just as easily apply a _left-hand rule_.)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $O$ be a connected, bounded, planar obstacle, and $P$ any location at which Bug 2 hits it.  Now consider the  curve $\\partial O$ traversed by the right hand rule.  This curve will be the boundary of $O$ if $O$ contains zero holes, but if $O$ contains holes then it will be some connected component of its boundary.  $\\partial O$ is a closed curve dividing the plane into two connected components, and a fact of plane geometry is that a closed curve $C$ separates two points $A \\notin C$ and $B \\notin C$ iff $\\overline{AB}$ intersects $C$ in an odd number of points.  Let $P^\\prime$ be the point immediately preceeding $P$ on the robot's path.  We know that $P^\\prime \\notin O$, and $\\|P^\\prime - G \\| > \\|P-G\\|$, because Bug 2 only moves toward the goal, never away from it.   So, if there is a path to the goal, then the line $\\overline{P^\\prime G}$ intersects $\\partial O$ an even number of times.   Hence, there is at least one other intersection point other than $P$.  Let $C$ be the closest intersection point.  The line segment between $C$ and $G$ will be pointing away from $O$, hence, we know that $C\\neq P$ since the line from $P$ to $G$ points into $O$.  Hence, the robot must break away at from $\\partial O$ at some closer point.  This establishes fact A.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, let $L$ be the point at which the robot leaves obstacle $O$.  If the robot hits another obstacle, it will have traveled in a straight line from $L$ to $G$, so its next hit point $P^\\prime$ is closer to $G$ than $L$.  Since $\\|P - G \\| > \\| L - G \\| > \\|P^\\prime - G\\|$, the sequence of hit points are decreasing in distance, establishing fact B.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we need to establish that termination at Step 5 correctly determines that no path exists.  As established in B, the sequence of hit points has decreasing distance, so an infinite loop is not possible: Bug 2 must either find the goal or terminate with \"No path\".  As established in A, \"No path\" will not be returned if there is a path to the goal. By contradiction, returning \"No path\" implies there is no path to the goal.  QED."

The sweep line algorithm passes through $n$ points, and either a continue, split, or merge operation must be performed for each point.

    "Exact cell decomposition algorithms have been extended to 3D spaces with polyhedral obstacles, but in general require sophisticated geometric reasoning about how the free space is cut into convex polyhedra.  An alternative technique is *approximate cell decomposition*, in which we do not worry about creating a decomposition of the true free space, but rather create cells that are contained in the free space.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible approach is that of an *octree*, which progressively subdivides the space into progressively smaller cubes until it can be determined that 1) a cube is *free*, i.e., completely within free space, 2) a cube is *closed*, i.e., completely inside an obstacle, or 3) a cube is smaller than a given resolution.  If a cube is neither free nor closed, it is *mixed*, and will be subdivided if it is larger than that resolution. An octree is constructed recursively, starting with a box $B_0$ that is know to contain the free space.  It proceeds by recursion on all boxes at level $i$. If a box is found to be mixed, then it is subdivided along each axis, which gives 8 child cubes (and hence the oct- prefix).\n",

    "An octree cell decomposition progressively divides an initial bounding cube $B_0$ into smaller cubes $B_{1a}$--$B_{1h}$.  A cube does not need to be subdivided if it is completely within the free space, or if it is completely contained within obstacles.  The right figure shows two levels of subdivision, with free cubes in white, obstacle cubes darkly shaded, and mixed cubes lightly shaded.\n",

    "Some more details are warranted on the collision checking step.  Suppose that obstacles are represented by triangle meshes. Then, if any triangle in the mesh overlaps the box, then the box is mixed.  Otherwise, the box is either free or closed.  It is somewhat difficult to tell whether the box is contained entirely inside an obstacle, but this case can be more or less safely ignored --- if our decomposition only contains free or closed cells, it cannot be the case that any free cell will be connected to any closed cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the octree is constructed, it is a matter of bookeeping to connect each non-mixed cell to its non-mixed neighbors, because on each of the 6 faces of a cell, the neighboring cell(s) may be at a finer level or a coarser level.  In this decomposition, if two free cells are connected, then there is certainly a free space path between them.  However, if two free cells are not connected, it is not certain whether a free space path exists.  Like grid search, this is a resolution complete method, because if the minimum resolution shrinks below a threshold (based on the clearance), then any free path connecting two points will correspond to a sequence of cells in the decomposition.\n"

    "### Motion planning in SE(2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Although some exact geometric techniques have been developed for planning in\n",
    "SE(2), it is more common to adopt resolution-complete techniques to\n",
    "handle the rotational DOF. As an example, grid search can be applied\n",
    "fairly easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "To apply grid search, the $\\theta$ dimension is split into several\n",
    "divisions on a grid over $[0,2\\pi)$, in addition to the $x$ and $y$\n",
    "dimensions. This gives a 3D grid graph that can be handled via search.\n",
    "To properly handle the topology of SO(2), vertices just below\n",
    "$\\theta=2\\pi$ are connected to the ones at $\\theta=0$. Specifically,\n",
    "suppose we have constructed a grid $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_k)$ with indices\n",
    "$i=1,\\ldots,m$, $j=1,\\ldots,n$, and $k=1,\\ldots,p$. We have\n",
    "$x_i = (i-1)\\Delta x$, $y_j=(j-1)\\Delta y$, and\n",
    "$\\theta_k= (k-1)\\Delta \\theta$, with $k=2\\pi/p$. Then, for each\n",
    "$i=1,\\ldots,m$, $j=1,\\ldots,n$ and $k=1,\\ldots,p$, the graph has an edge\n",
    "from each $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_k)$ to $(x_{i+1},y_j,\\theta_k)$ and\n",
    "$(x_i,y_{j+1},\\theta_k)$ (as long as that incremented index does not\n",
    "exceed the limit), and $(x_i,y_j,\\theta_{k+1\\mod p})$. This leads to at\n",
    "most 6 connections per vertex. Diagonal motions can also be added, which\n",
    "results in 26-connected vertices (each vertex can be thought of being in\n",
    "the center of a $3\\times 3\\times 3$ box).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when applying search, a cost function needs to be assigned to\n",
    "each edge. Because translation is measured in different units (say,\n",
    "meters) than orientation (degrees or radians), it may not make much\n",
    "sense to use Euclidean distance as the cost! As an extreme example, let\n",
    "us assume that orientation is measured in degrees and translation in\n",
    "meters, and suppose the robot would need to turn $90^\\circ$ to pass\n",
    "through a narrow gap, then rotate back $90^\\circ$ to reach a goal 1 m\n",
    "away. A planner using Euclidean distance would prefer to take a\n",
    "roundabout path (up to 180 m longer!) to get to the goal without\n",
    "reorientation. At a different extreme, let us assume that orientation is\n",
    "measured in radians and translation in millimeters. Then, the robot\n",
    "would prefer to pass through the gap even when there exists a slightly\n",
    "longer path that does not require reorientation.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result it is usually prudent to adopt a *weighted metric* as cost,\n",
    "such as the following:\n",
    "$$c((x,y,\\theta),(x^\\prime,y^\\prime,\\theta^\\prime)) = \\sqrt{(x-x^\\prime)^2+(y-y^\\prime)^2+w_\\theta diff(\\theta,\\theta^\\prime)^2}.$$\n",
    "Here, $diff$ is the geodesic angular distance in SO(2), and the weight\n",
    "term $w_\\theta$ should be chosen to balance the tradeoff between\n",
    "translation and rotation. One reasonable choice is to set\n",
    "$w_\\theta = R^2$ where $R$ is the radius of the robot. For axis-aligned\n",
    "motions, this weighted cost bounds the maximum distance that a point on\n",
    "the robot could move during a straight line motion\n",
    "$(x,y,\\theta)\\rightarrow (x^\\prime,y^\\prime,\\theta^\\prime)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cell decomposition can also be extended in a resolution-complete fashion\n",
    "to SE(2) by splitting $\\theta$ into discrete values, and thinking of the\n",
    "$(x,y)$ plane as a \"layer\" in 3D space. The C-obstacle for that layer\n",
    "can be computed using Minkowski sums, and then its cell decomposition\n",
    "computed. Then, an edge is added to connect cells on adjacent layers\n",
    "whose $(x,y)$ projections overlap. This layered cell graph can then be\n",
    "searched to connect any two points in SE(2)."

    "-------\n",
    "\n",
    "* Geometric motion planning methods can achieve completeness or resolution completeness in low-dimensional configuration spaces.\n",
    "* The major classes of geometric planners are bug methods, grid search, visibility graph methods, and cell decomposition.\n",
    "* Bug algorithms only use local information about obstacles and a small amount of memory to make decisions on-line.  They are sufficiently simple that their completeness and suboptimality can be analyzed using geometric reasoning.\n",
    "* Grid search methods are quite general, can be applied to robots with arbitrary geometry, and can be extended to solve curvature-constrained problems using the state lattice approach.  They are resolution-complete, and their performance depends heavily on the grid resolution, and somewhat on the grid search heuristic.\n",
    "* Visibility graph methods build a network of free paths between obstacle vertices. They are complete and optimal in 2D configuration spaces, but take at least $O(n^2)$ time and $O(n^2)$ space to build.\n",
    "* Cell decomposition methods build a representation of the free space volume as a collection of simple geometric shapes. They can be complete, optimal, and constructed efficiently ($O(n \\log n)$ for the trapezoidal decomposition).\n",
    "* Translating robots with geometry can be converted into point robot problems by constructing C-obstacles. This can be done using the Minkowski difference operation."

    "Exercises\n",
    "---------\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If all obstacles are convex and non-overlapping, is the Bug 1\n",
    "    complete? If so, prove it. If not, produce a counterexample.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Suppose that the bug had a $360^\\circ$ distance sensor with some\n",
    "    maximum range $R$ to detect the shape of obstacles around it.\n",
    "    Specifically, suppose that it knows the shape of all obstacles in a\n",
    "    circle of radius $R$. Could you modify Bug 1 so that the bug can\n",
    "    reach the goal with a shorter path (when it terminates)? Bug 1\n",
    "    should be equivalent to your new algorithm when $R=0$. Prove that\n",
    "    your method produces paths of length no longer than paths produced\n",
    "    by Bug 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Prove that the minimum length path in a polygonal environment is\n",
    "    either a straight line or passes through obstacle vertices. Then\n",
    "    prove that the visibility graph method yields a path with minimum\n",
    "    length. _Hint: consider whether a locally suboptimal path can be\n",
    "    improved by \"shortcutting\" one of the corners of the path._\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Is grid search with 4-connected neighbors in a plane approximately\n",
    "    optimal, provided that clearance is sufficiently large, and the\n",
    "    length of an optimal path is greater than the grid resolution? If\n",
    "    so, derive an approximation factor. If not, show a class of\n",
    "    environments in which an arbitrarily poor approximation factor can\n",
    "    be constructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Create a modified `grid_search` algorithm in `rsbook_code.planning.grid_search`\n",
    "    that accepts a `max_time` parameter that gives a maximum time budget\n",
    "    for search.  After this amount of time has elapsed, no more nodes\n",
    "    should be evaluated, and instead the algorithm should return the path\n",
    "    leading to the explored node that got closest to the goal. \n",
    "    _Hint: you can raise an exception to break out of the search loop._\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  The *medial axis* of the free space is the set of free points that are equidistant between exactly \n",
    "    two or more points on the obstacle boundary.  Draw the medial axis of the simple environment in Fig. 1.\n",
    "    Could the medial axis be considered a form of roadmap?  Describe a path planning algorithm that could\n",
    "    accept a medial axis as input and produce a path.\n",
    "\n",
    "7.  Prove that the medial axis of a free space with polygonal obstacles consists of straight lines and\n",
    "    parabolic arcs.  (Hint: recall the focus and directrix that define a parabola.)\n",
    "\n",
    "8.  Give pseudocode for computing the Minkowski sum of two convex\n",
    "    polygons in O($m+n$) time.\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  What is the configuration space of two disk-shaped mobile robots\n",
    "    that can translate in the plane? What C-space obstacles exist in\n",
    "    this space, assuming they are not allowed to collide with the\n",
    "    environment or each other? Extend your description of the C-space\n",
    "    and C-space obstacles to $n$ robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Suppose $R$ is the maximum radius of the robot with respect to its\n",
    "    reference point. Produce a cost metric for SE(2) that bounds the\n",
    "    distance traveled by any point on the robot as it moves from\n",
