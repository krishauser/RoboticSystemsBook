    "developing motions and choosing postures, since a robot should avoid\n",
    "unintentional collision with the environment, and should make contact\n",
    "when desired. Geometry is also important in robot design, since the\n",

    "points $\\mathbf{p}_1,\\ldots,\\mathbf{p}_N$ from the geometry surface $\\partial G$.\n",

    "There are two major types of point-based representations: **point clouds**\n",
    "and **depth images** (aka range images). A point cloud is simply an\n",
    "unstructured list of points with no assumption of regularity. Points are\n",
    "not a priori identified to objects, nor to each other. This type of\n",
    "representation results from moving lidar sensors and naively merged\n",
    "depth scans.  Variants of point clouds include *surfels*, which include\n",
    "normal information to represent the geometry as many little disks, and *gaussian splats*,\n",
    "in which each point is represented by an ellipsoidal distribution around it. \n",
    "\n",
    "A depth image is a 2D grayscale image indicating the distance from the\n",

    "### Representing rigid poses and movement\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is so common to represent objects as rigid bodies, it is much easier to model the movement of an object as the movement of an rigid body frame, rather than to explicitly modify the geometry itself.  This *implicit transformation* approach is used ubiquitously in robotics, visualization, and computer graphics.  Specifically, we imagine the object to have a local *reference frame*, and define a *local geometry* $G_L \\subset R^3$ in the local coordinates.  The object's *pose* is a transformation $T$ from the reference frame to the world frame. As the object moves, $T$ changes, but the local geometry data remains static.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we can represent the set of points contained by the object $G(t) \\subset R^3$ at time $t$ given only the pose $T(t)$.  The two representations are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explicit transformation: $G(t) = \\{ T(t)x \\quad|\\quad x \\in G_L \\}$.  (Imagine the points of the local geometry moving with the object's transform.)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implicit transformation: $G(t) = \\{ x \\in R^3 \\quad|\\quad T(t)^{-1} x \\in G_L \\}$.  (Imagine the points in world coordinates being projected back into the reference frame.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is much more efficient to change transforms than geometry data, the implicit transformation approach is preferred in most cases, except perhaps geometric primitives.  For example, if a triangle mesh with 1,000,000 points undergoes a rotation and translation, this can be calculated using 1,000,000 3x3 matrix-vector multiplies and the same number of 3-vector additions. But, in the implicit representation, we can update a transform only by 1 4x4 matrix multiply (using homogeneous coordinates), or 1 3x3 matrix-matrix multiply, a matrix-vector multiply, and a 3-vector addition (using rotation matrix and translation vectors).  Henceforth, we will describe a geometry $G$ in the implicit form as a local-geometry / transform pair $G=(G_L,T)$.  "

    "will take place in the world frame.  In other words, we delay transforming any primitives and\n",
    "bounding volumes to the world frame until just before each geometric operation takes place.\n",
    "\n",
    "The BVH structure is an important determinant of ultimate collision query performance.\n",
    "For best performance, we would like the BVH to satisfy several properties:\n",
    "1. *Balanced*. The BVH should be a balanced tree to minimize its height.\n",
    "2. *Tightness*. The BVs of non-leaf nodes $N$ to be tightly wrapped around the geometry\n",
    "   $G_L(N)$ contained therein, so that portions of the geometry can be pruned quickly.\n",
    "3. *Spatial coherence*. Child BVs should contain portions of the geometry that are separated\n",
    "   as far as possible to encourage fast pruning. (This is related to tightness.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A BVH is typically created either in top-down or bottom-up fashion.  Top-down construction\n",

    "If $S$ is small enough (contains one or a few primitives), then a leaf node $N$ is output with $S$\n",

    "and the children are $N$ are recursively constructed by subdividing $S$ into two (or more) parts.\n",
    "To encourage tightness and spatial coherence, one approach is construct the subdivision by finding a\n",
    "dividing plane, and create two children containing primitives on either side of the plane. To\n",
    "encourage balance, the dividing plane should approximately divide $S$ into two subsets of equal size.\n",
    "\n",
    "In bottom-up fashion, a leaf node is constructed for each primitive. Then, pairs of\n",
    "nearby or highly overlapping nodes are aggregated into non-leaf nodes.  This process repeats\n",
    "until only one node remains (the root).  There is a choice here about how to construct a BV of two\n",
    "aggregated nodes.  Either the BV could be constructed by bounding the children BVs (looser but faster), or by bounding the underlying geometry (tighter but slower).\n",
    "\n",
    "Both processes are relatively expensive, with top-down computation taking at least $O(n h)$ time,\n",
    "where $h$ is the height of the BVH tree, and bottom-up computation taking at least $O(n \\log n)$ time,\n",
    "depending on how efficiently pairwise aggregation can be performed.  However, the expense is worthwhile\n",
    "particularly if it can be amortized over many collision queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the geometry $G_L$ itself changes frequently, then the BVH must be recomputed.  If the change is slight,\n",

    "* [Convex / concave](#convex-polytope): A convex geometry satisfies the property that the line segment containing any two points within the geometry are also within the geometry.\n",
    "* [Surface representation](#Surface-representations): Any geometry representation that directly models the surface of the geometry.\n",
    "* [Volumetric representation](#Volumetric-representations): Any geometry representation that directly models the volume of space that the geometry occupies.\n",
    "* [Point-based representation](#Point-based-representations): Any geometry representation that directly models sample points on the surface of the geometry.\n",
    "* [Triangle mesh](#triangle-mesh): The most common geometry representation used in robotics and computer graphics, consisting of a network of (usually) connected triangles.\n",
    "* [Convex polytope](#convex-polytope): A geometry representation that consists of the convex hull of a set of vertices, or the solutions to a system of halfplane inequations.\n",
    "* [Point cloud](#Point-based-representations): A representation of a set of points sampled on the surface of the geometry.\n",
    "* [Occupancy grid](#Volumetric-representations): A volumetric, grid-based representation that stores a value from 0 to 1 indicating a confidence about whether each grid cell contains geometry or not. A popular representation for mapping algorithms.\n",
    "* [Signed distance field (SDF)](#Volumetric-representations): A volumetric, grid-based representation that stores the signed distance of each grid vertex to the surface of the geometry.  Positive values indicate outside, negative values indicate inside, and zero represents the surface.\n",
    "* [Truncated signed distance field (TSDF)](#Volumetric-representations): A variant of the SDF in which only signed distance values within some truncation range containing 0 are stored.  A popular representation for 3D mapping algorithms.\n",

    "* [Collision detection](#Proximity-queries): The operation of determining whether two objects occupy any point in common.\n",
    "* [Distance calculation](#Proximity-queries): The operation of calculating the minimum distance between two objects.  Often, a signed distance is desired, in which the negative penetration distance is reported if the objects are colliding.\n",

    "* [Separation principle](#Separation-principle-for-convex-objects): Two convex objects do not overlap if and only if there exists a plane in which one object lies completely in the positive side and the other lies in the negative side.\n",
    "* [Bounding volume hierarchy (BVH)](#Bounding-volume-hierarchies): A tree-based collision acceleration data structure for objects consisting of many primitive geometries.  Each node in the tree bounds a subset of the geometry's primitives, with leaf nodes consisting of the primitives themselves.\n",
    "* [Broad phase collision detection](#road-phase-collision-detection): The first phase of collision detection for scenes composed of many objects in which objects that are too distant to collide are quickly eliminated from further consideration. \n",
    "* [Fast marching method (FMM)](#Volume-to-surface): A fast algorithm for calculating triangle meshes from implicit surfaces, SDFs, and TSDFs.\n",
    "* [Space carving](#Space-carving): A technique to compute volumetric representations from depth maps or silhouettes coming from multiple camera views. For each view, cells are converted to free space for each line segment in which it is certain that material does not exist."

    "1.  Write pseudocode to fully develop the convex polygon-polygon\n",
    "    collision detection algorithm <a href=\"#Collision-detection-between-convex-polygons-in-2D\">described above</a>. What is the time\n",
    "    complexity of this algorithm? Your answer should be in terms of $m$\n",

    "    detection algorithm for *non-convex polygons* briefly <a href=\"#Collision-detection-between-convex-polygons-in-2D\">described above</a>. What is the time\n",
    "    complexity of this algorithm? Your answer should be in terms of $m$\n",
    "    and $n$, the number of vertices of each polygon.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Devise pseudocode for determining whether a point cloud intersects\n",
    "    with an implicit surface, both of which are represented in\n",
    "    implicitly-transformed fashion.  (A brute-force method is fine.)  Can you\n",
    "    generalize this pseudocode to other types of geometry, provided\n",
    "    that an inside-outside containment tester is given? \n",
    "\n",
    "4.  Implement the grid-based broad-phase collision detection technique\n",
    "    described in <a href=\"#broadphase\">Section 3.5</a> for disk-shaped objects. \n",
    "    Compare the running time of this algorithm with the brute-\n",
    "    force collision detection with varying numbers of objects, added\n",
    "    at random.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Investigate what geometry representations can be imported and\n",
    "    exported from a CAD program (e.g., Solidworks, AutoCAD). Investigate\n",
    "    what geometry representations are directly available from an RGB-D\n",
    "    camera (e.g., Microsoft Kinect, Intel Realsense). Investigate what\n",
    "    geometry representations are used in a 3D mapping program (Google\n",
    "    Project Tango, Pix4D, AutoCAD Map 3D).\n",
    "\n",
    "6.  Suppose that you are implementing a 3D mapping algorithm for mobile indoor robots\n",

    "    200m x 200m x 30m (multiple floors of a building).  Specify the memory requirements\n",
    "    for a 3D grid representation, a triangle mesh representation, and a point cloud\n",
    "    representation.  Suppose that you store RGB colors in a 32-bit integer, positions\n",
    "    (if necessary) as single-precision floating point numbers, and desire a map with\n",
    "    spatial resolution of 5cm. \n",
    "\n",
    "7.  What is the relationship between a geometry representation's *resolution* and its *fidelity*?\n",
    "    Are they equivalent concepts, unrelated, or does one determine the other? Or is the relationship more complex?  \n",
    "\n",
    "8.  A bounding volume hierarchy can be defined with different types of shapes.  Consider\n",
    "    the pros and cons of using 1) spheres, 2) axis-aligned bounding boxes, and 3) oriented boxes.\n",
    "    Which shape(s) is expected to have the tightest fit to the geometry?  Which shape(s) has the fastest\n",

    "    explicitly updated when the geometry undergoes a rigid transformation?\n",
    "\n",
    "9.  Experimentally investigate the running time of bounding volume\n",
    "    hierarchy collision detection software. First, examine how\n",
    "    precomputation time varies with the complexity of the model. Is the\n",
    "    running time linear, quadratic, or something else? Next, examine how\n",
    "    query time varies with the complexity of the two models and their\n",
    "    proximity. Explain your observations in terms of how many bounding\n",
    "    volumes are checked.\n",

    "10. Write pseudocode for performing a ray-cast query for a triangle mesh in brute-force fashion.\n",
    "    Assume a subroutine is available for computing ray-triangle intersections, called\n",
    "    `rayTriangleIntersect(a,b,triangle)` where `a` is the ray start point, `b` is a point along\n",
    "    the ray, and it returns the distance `d` to the intersection point if there is an intersection,\n",
    "    and returns `d=`$\\infty$ if there is no intersection.\n",
    "    Then, write pseudocode for an accelerated version a using a bounding volume hierarchy. Assume\n",
    "    a subroutine is available for compute ray-BV intersections, called `rayBVIntersect(a,b,BV)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. An autonomous vehicle or wheeled mobile robot will sense an environment\n",
    "    in 3D, but navigates essentially on a 2D semi-planar ground.  Suppose \n",
    "    that a laser sensor is used to provide information about the ground surface\n",
    "    and obstacles in the form of a 3D point cloud.  Suppose the robot knows where\n",
    "    it is, and where its sensor is located on its chassis.  What processing\n",
    "    steps would need to take place to convert the 3D data into a 2D obstacle map\n",
    "    assuming that the ground was almost entirely flat (say, with height variation\n",
    "    below 2cm)?  What would complicate this process if the ground is not flat,\n",
    "    such as curbs, hills, speed bumps, and ramps?  What information might be available in the point\n",
    "    cloud for you to treat curbs as obstacles, but not hills, speed bumps, and ramps?  What complications\n",
    "    would arise when due to the nature of point cloud data?"
