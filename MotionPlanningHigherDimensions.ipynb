In Monte-Carlo sampling, there is a hidden constant in the approximation error that depends on the variance of $f$ across the domain.  Likewise, sampling-based planning induces a probabilistic chance of failure, and the risk of failure is highly dependent on the *visibility properties* of the free space.

    "Intuitively, the milestones in a PRM $(V,E)$ with $n$ milestones are likely to connect to a new milestone if the visibility set of $V$ is large.  Formally, if a new milestone $q$ is sampled uniformly at random from $\\mathcal{F}$, then the probability that it can be connected to $V$ is exactly $\\mu(V)/\\mu(\\mathcal{F})$.  Since visibility is symmetric, the probability that $q$ cannot be connected to any of the milestones in $V$ is equal to the probability that $q$ cannot be connected to any of $n$ random configurations.  Since the milestones are drawn independently at random, this probability is $(1-\\mu(\\mathcal{V}(q))/\\mu(\\mathcal{F}))^{n}$.  Hence, obtain the result:\n",

    "What this also shows is that if visibility properties are not uniform across the free space &mdash; that is, visibility sets are small in some areas (narrow passages) and large in others (wide passages) &mdash; PRMs will have a harder time connecting milestones in narrow passages.  This is because the speed at which $Pr(q\\text{ connected})$ approaches 1 is dependent on $\\mu(\\mathcal{V}(q))/\\mu(\\mathcal{F})$, with larger values converging to 1 much faster than smaller values.  (On average, $\\mu(\\mathcal{F})/\\mu(\\mathcal{V}(q))$ milestones will be needed in $|V|$ before $q$ lies in the visibility set of $V$.)  \n",

    "We can analyze this situation further using bounds that depend on the shape of the free space. Suppose that the minimum volume of any configuration's visibility set is $\\epsilon = \\inf_{q\\in \\mathcal{F}}\\mu(\\mathcal{V}(q))/\\mu(\\mathcal{F})$.  Then, for any point $q$ sampled at random, the probability that it can be connected to a given point $q'$ is at least $\\epsilon$.

Keep in mind that we have not mentioned dimensionality $d$ in this discussion and only volumetric ratios, so the performance here has no direct relation to $d$.  However, note that with a fixed connection radius $R$, the volume of any visible set cannot be greater than $O(R^d)$ (the volume of an $R$-ball), and hence there is an implicit exponential dependence of performance on dimension.

Specifically, we need to examine whether milestones in the same connected component of $\\mathcal{F}$ are also in the same connected component of $(V,E)$.  For this, we need a concept called **expansiveness**.  Intuitively, a space $\\mathcal{F}$ has high expansiveness if for any partition of $\\mathcal{F}$ into two sets $A$ and $B$, a significant portion of $A$ can see a significant portion of $B$.

    "#### Lazy collision checking in PRMs\n",
    "\n",
    "For complex robots and/or environments, such as those composed of CAD models, the most significant computational expense in PRMs and RRTs is checking visibility of edges (i.e., [dynamic collision checking](#Dynamic-collision-checking) because each check may require tens, hundreds, or thousands of static collision checks.  Furthermore, for complex robots, self-collision testing may need to be performed beween all *pairs* of links, so even a single static collision check can take milliseconds of compute time.  This can add up quickly, as the roadmap begins to contain thousands of milestones.\n",
    "\n",
    "An effective heuristic for accelerating PRM performance is to perform *lazy collision checking*, which delays collision checking for edges until a candidate path to the goal is found.  The hypothesis is that if the endpoints of an edge are collision free, then the path between them is also likely to be free.  Since most edges in the PRM aren't used in the final path, it is a waste to devote effort checking their collision status.  If the path does contain a collision, the offending edge can be removed and planning can continue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Lazy PRM algorithm can be implemented in both basic and incremental forms.  A lazy [Basic PRM](#PRM) variant is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a PRM $(V,E)$, assuming IsVisible always returns true.\n",
    "2. Find a path from $s$ to $g$, $v_1=s,v_2,\\ldots,v_{m-1},v_m=g$ using search.  If no path is found, return failure.\n",

    "5. If all edges are feasible, return $v_1 \\rightarrow v_2 \\rightarrow\\cdots \\rightarrow v_m$ as the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this design, it is helpful to cache which edges have been found to be visible to avoid re-checking edges in step 3.  Another speed improvement is to use the costs of optimal paths to $g$ in the original PRM as a heuristic for A* search (used in the Batch Informed Trees* algorithm).\n",
    "\n",
    "A lazy [incremental PRM](#alg:IncrementalPRM) variant is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. During roadmap construction, IsVisible is assumed to always return true.\n",
    "2. In line 15, once a path is found to the goal, the shortest path connecting $s$ and $g$ is checked for collision, as in steps 2 &ndash; 5 in the lazy Basic PRM variant.\n",
    "3. Connected components need to be recomputed when edges are found to be infeasible.\n",
    "\n",
    "To implement this efficiently, step 3 must be implemented so that connected components can be updated quickly when the graph changes. One way of doing this in conjunction with the path search is a *dynamic shortest paths* data structure, which stores the cost of the shortest path to every node in the graph.  This data structure should be updated every time an edge is added or removed. Although in the worst case, $O(n)$ costs must be updated, the vast majority of cases are typically cheap.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adapt RRT to perform lazy collision checking, we have a problem figuring out what to do with infeasible edges. Suppose we find that an edge near the start is infeasible:  discarding it would break the tree structure, or we could delete the subtree of descendants of the edge, but this would waste a significant amount of prior effort.  Instead, a bidirectional tree-based lazy collision checking strategy, introduced in the SBL algorithm (Sanchez-Ante and Latombe, 2003), avoids discarding subtrees. Instead, it maintains bidirectional trees as in RRT-Connected, and checks edges for collision once a path is found from the start to the goal.  If an edge is found to be in collision, then it *switches the subtree* of descendants of that edge to the other subtree.  This takes a degree of bookkeeping to update the tree data structures, but can be done quickly."

(In most cases, however, we do not have access to an exact clearance function, but this reasoning still works when $c(q)$ is any lower bound on clearance.)  This gives the following exact algorithm:\n",

Moreover, in a movement of $\\theta$ radians, the tip of the link moves at most $L_1 \\theta$ distance in workspace.  Hence, $$\\eta_1(q,q^\\prime) = L_1 |q_1 - q^\\prime_1 |$$ is a suitable upper bound.  Through similar reasoning, we can show that $$\\eta_2(q,q^\\prime) = (L_1+L_2) (|q_1 - q^\\prime_1 | + |q_2 - q^\\prime_2 |)$$ is an upper bound on how far the tip of link 2 moves.

This runs in $O(n)$ time, and similar algorithms can be used for kNN() and near() queries.  It is also highly general, and can work with arbitrary metrics and spaces.

We first recurse on the corresponding child (Lines 7 &ndash; 11).  This recursive call may update $p_{close}$.  Then, Lines 12 &ndash; 13 consider whether to check the opposite child.  If $|q_{dim} - value| \\geq d_{close}$, the distance $|q_{dim} - value|$ to the splitting hyperplane is sufficiently large that there is no chance that the closest point lies within the region defined by the opposite child.  Hence, recursion on the opposite child can be skipped.  Regardless of the outcome, we return $p_{close}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insertion.** To insert points into a $k$-d tree, we can simply locate the leaf node in which the point is located, and add it to the `pts` structure.  If the number of points in `pts` exceeds some threshold, defined by a given parameter, then the node is converted into a non-leaf node via splitting.  Letting `dim` be the axis of the parent, the chosen axis can either be `(dim+1) mod d` (round-robin splitting) or the dimension with the largest variation in `pts`.  In either case, `value` is set to the median value of `pts` in that dimension.  A potential problem with incremental insertion is that unless the points are distributed identically at random, the split value of a leaf may not bisect the distribution of future points, leading to an imbalanced tree.  More advanced algorithms may detect imbalanced trees during construction and rebalance them.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extensions.**  $k$-d trees can be extended easily to weighted Euclidean distances, since a weighted Euclidean distance is equivalent to a rescaled version of Euclidean space.  They can be extended to handle other distance metrics or non-Cartesian spaces with a bit more effort.  For other distance metrics, the main challenge is determining the point-hyperplane distance $\\min_{p | p[dim]=value} d(p,q)$ rather than the straightforward calculation  in Line 13.  Non-Cartesian spaces require an alternative definition of the splitting plane, sidedness determination (Line 7), and a point-splitting plane distance (Line 13).  Insertion also needs to be modified to determine a reasonable splitting plane.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Performance.** Notice in the NN query, recursion proceeds in depth first fashion, and the first leaf node found is associated with the region containing $q$.  Ideally, the closest point in this region will be very close to $q$, and hence most of the opposite sides will be pruned.  In the best case, all of the opposite sides will be pruned and this runs in $O(\\log |P|)$ time.  In the worst case, all $P$ points must be checked, in addition to the overhead of traversing the tree, making this no better than brute-force search.  \n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that performance degrades if the points are nonuniformly distributed or the tree is imbalanced, that is, the number of points on either side of a split differ significantly.  Performance also degrades in spaces of higher dimension, because point-point distances tend to be much larger than point-hyperplane distances."

    "#### Approximate methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to the degradation in performance of $k$-d trees in spaces of higher dimension, it is common to apply approximate nearest neighbors techniques.  These sacrifice exactness of the output for speed improvements.  The sacrifice of exactness is usually worth it in sampling-based planning because for most algorithms *there is no inherent reason to use the exact nearest neighbor(s) for connection* except that a closer milestone is slightly more likely to yield a feasible edge than a farther one.  \n",
    "\n",
    "One straightforward approximate method that uses $k$-d trees is to modify the pruning condition $|q_{dim} - value| \\leq d(q,p_{close})$ in Line 13 so that more nodes are pruned.  A typical approach is to inflate the point-hyperplane distance by a relative coefficient $\\epsilon_{rel}\\geq 0$ and absolute coefficient $\\epsilon_{abs}\\geq 0$ so that the condition in Line 13 becomes $(1+\\epsilon_{rel})\\cdot|q_{dim} - value| + \\epsilon_{abs} \\leq d(q,p_{close})$.  With such an approach, it is easy to show that the distance of the resulting point $p_{close}$ to $q$ is no more than $(1+\\epsilon_{res})d^\\star + \\epsilon_{abs}$.  With larger values of $\\epsilon_{res}$ and $\\epsilon_{abs}$, more branches are pruned at a sacrifice of optimality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approximation technique is Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH), which is based on the idea that if two points are close, then random projections of the points onto a lower dimensional subspace are also likely to be close.  The details of LSH are beyond the scope of this book, but [many references are available](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing).\n",

Both libraries accept an approximation factor.  For approximate nearest neighbors, there are many packages named ANN, and the [FLANN](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann/) library is a popular choice, used in the [Open Motion Planning Library](#https://ompl.kavrakilab.org/)."

    "Trajectory optimization is another potential-based method that optimizes\n",
    "the overall shape of the robot's path to minimize cost. Unlike potential\n",
    "fields, for which the optimization variable is the configuration of a\n",
    "single point in time, trajectory optimization uses some parameterization\n",
    "of the *entire* path as the optimization variable. This helps it avoid\n",
    "future obstacles and, in some cases, avoid local minima that potential\n",
    "fields would fall prey to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Such methods begins with the definition of some fixed number of *path\n",
    "parameters* $\\theta \\in \\mathbb{R}^N$ which dictate the shape of a\n",
    "candidate path. One example, for piecewise linear paths passing between\n",
    "the start and the goal configuration, is simply the set of intermediate\n",
    "milestones: $$\\theta = (q_1,\\ldots,q_{k-1})$$ In this case, the path\n",
    "$y(s)$ consists of $k$ straight-line segments, interpolating between\n",
    "milestones $q_0=q_s, q_1, \\ldots, q_{k-1}, q_k=q_g$. Any value of\n",
    "$\\theta$ dictates the shape of some path, and any piecewise linear path\n",
    "with $k$ segments corresponds to some value of $\\theta$. To make this\n",
    "dependence clear, we shall refer to the path defined by some value\n",
    "$\\theta$ as $y_\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Figure 14\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dimension of C-space is $d$, then $N = d(k-1)$. Hence the\n",
    "trajectory optimization problem can be quite high dimensional (hundreds\n",
    "or thousands of dimensions) even for C-spaces with a moderate number of\n",
    "dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we must encode the objective function and constraints. For\n",
    "minimizing path length, it may be tempting to initially define the\n",
    "following cost function that minimizes path length:\n",
    "$$f(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\| q_i - q_{i-1} \\|.$$ However, this\n",
    "formulation has the drawback that it is not differentiable when two\n",
    "milestones are equal, and also has a null direction when three\n",
    "milestones are on the straight line. It is more numerically convenient\n",
    "to minimize the sum of squared distances\n",
    "$$f(\\theta) = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\| q_i - q_{i-1} \\|^2.$$ which, if a\n",
    "$k$-segment piecewise linear path is indeed optimal, is minimized when\n",
    "the path (nearly) has minimum length and the milestones are evenly\n",
    "spaced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let us proceed to defining constraints, which we assume are in the\n",
    "form $g(q) \\leq 0$. At first glance, one might choose to simply enforce\n",
    "constraints on the milestones:\n",
    "$$h(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}{g(q_1)} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {g(q_{k-1})} \\end{bmatrix} \\leq 0.$$\n",
    "However, this runs the risk of having two milestones on either side of\n",
    "an obstacle, with the intermediate segment crossing the obstacle.\n",
    "Instead, we must consider the possibility of constraint violations\n",
    "between milestones. A straightforward way to do so is to use\n",
    "*collocation points*, which are points along the path at which\n",
    "constraints will be enforced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically we can define some number $M$ of collocation points at\n",
    "parameters $s_1,\\ldots,s_M \\in [0,1]$, usually evenly distributed along\n",
    "the parameter space $[0,1]$. The $j$'th collocation point lies on a\n",

    "determined so that the configuration at the collocation point is:\n",
    "$$y_\\theta(s_j) = q_{i_j-1} + u_j (q_{i_j} - q_{i_j-1}).$$ We then\n",
    "define many inequality constraints on $\\theta$ so that constraints at\n",
    "each collocation point are enforced:\n",
    "$$h(\\theta) = \\begin{bmatrix}{g(y_\\theta(s_1))} \\\\ {\\vdots} \\\\ {g(y_\\theta(s_M))} \\end{bmatrix} \\leq 0.$$\n",
    "The resulting problem is a constrained optimization problem\n",

    "nonlinear program solver, like Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP).\n",
    "Efficient implementations will take advantage of sparseness in the\n",
    "constraint Jacobian.\n",
    "\n",

    "if $w$ is not set to be sufficiently high, then the optimizer of the\n",
    "weighted objective function will still slightly overlap with the\n",
    "obstacle. To address this, we can progressively increase $w$ to reduce\n",
