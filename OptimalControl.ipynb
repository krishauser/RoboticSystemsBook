    "$$J(x,u) = \\int_0^\\infty L(x(t),u(t),t) dt.$$ The term *functional*\n",
    "indicates that this is a function mapping a function to a real number.\n",

    "penalize certain undesirable states, velocities, or controls. Its units\n",

    "often necessary to prove existence of an optimal solution first, or to\n",
    "relax the problem to determine only an approximate optimal.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cost functionals\n",
    "\n",
    "A variety of behaviors can be specified in this framework by modifying\n",
    "the instantaneous cost. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trajectory tracking for a trajectory $x_D(t)$ can be implemented by penalizing squared error $L(x,u,t) = \\|x - x_D(t)\\|^2$.\n",
    "- Minimizing effort can be defined in terms of a control penalty $\\|u\\|^2$.\n",
    "- Minimum time to hit a target $x_{tgt}$ could be implemented as an indicator function $I[x\\neq x_{tgt}$ where $I[z]$ is 1 if $z$ is true, and 0 otherwise.\n",
    "- Obstacle avoidance and other feasibility constraints can be implemented as indicator functions as well, $\\infty \\cdot I[x \\notin \\mathcal{F}]$ where $\\mathcal{F}$ is the free space.\n",
    "- Smoothed obstacle avoidance can be implemented by a repulsive barrier that decreases to 0 when the distance to the closest obstacle $d$ exceeds some minimum buffer distance $d_{min}$ and incrases to infinity as the distance shrinks to 0. One common form of this barrier is $L(x,u,t) = 1/d^2 - 1/d_{min}^2$ when $d < d_{min}$ and $L(x,u,t) = 0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to mix and match different types of costs functionals using a _weighted cost functional_ $$J(x,u) = \\sum_{i=1}^N w_i J_i(x,u)$$\n",
    "where each $J_i(x,u)$ is some primitive cost functional and $w_i$ scales its contribution to the final cost. By tuning these weights, a designer can encourage the optimized trajectories to emphasize some aspects of the trajectory over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Finite horizon optimal control and discounting\n",
    "\n",
    "As stated the optimal control problem is somewhat ill-behaved because it\n",
    "involves an infinite integral, which could achieve infinite cost even\n",
    "for relatively well-behaved trajectories. For example, if the cost were\n",
    "simply squared error, a trajectory that achieves 0.01 steady-state error\n",
    "would be rated as having the same cost as a trajectory that had an error\n",
    "of 1: namely, infinitely bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two general ways to make the cost functional better behaved.\n",
    "The first method to truncate the problem at some maximum time $T$,\n",
    "leading to a *finite-horizon optimal control* cost functional\n",
    "$$J(x,u) = \\int_0^T L(x(t),u(t),t) dt + \\Phi(x(T))$$ where $\\Phi(x)$ is\n",
    "a nonnegative *terminal cost* that penalizes the state attained at the\n",
    "terminal time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second method is to modify the instantaneous cost functional by\n",
    "including a *discount factor* that decays to 0 relatively quickly as\n",
    "$t \\rightarrow infty$. This is usually expressed as the product of a\n",
    "time-independent term and a time-dependent discount factor term:\n",
    "$$L(x,u,t) = L(x,u,0) \\gamma(t)$$ with $\\gamma(t)$ a decaying function,\n",
    "such as $O(1/t^\\alpha)$ or $O(\\beta^t)$. It is important to choose a\n",
    "discount factor that drops relatively rapidly toward 0 to ensure that\n",
    "the cost is integrable. Discount factors of the form $O(1/t^\\alpha)$\n",
    "must have $\\alpha > 1$ to ensure that the cost functional is finite for\n",
    "all bounded trajectories, and those of the form $O(\\beta^t)$ must have\n",
    "$\\beta < 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State and Control Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, optimal control solvers require that the cost functional is\n",
    "smooth, and so non-differentiable constraints like minimum time and\n",
    "obstacle avoidance must be reformulated as hard constraints, external to\n",
    "the cost functional. As a result the reformulation becomes essentially\n",
    "an infinite-dimensional constrained optimization problem. Solvers may\n",
    "differ about whether they can handle constraints on state or constraints\n",
    "on control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analytical vs Numerical Solvers\n",
    "\n",
    "Minimization over a space of functions is considerably more difficult to\n",
    "solve than typical optimization problems: the space of functions is\n",
    "*uncountably infinite-dimensional*! There are two general ways to tackle\n",

    "mathematical conditions of optimality so that the optimal control can be\n",

    "the problem as a finite dimensional optimization. These are more\n",

    "### Other control / state parameterizations\n",
    "\n",
    "As an alternative to piecewise constant controls, it is also possible to\n",

    "The difficulty with such parameterizations is that the state trajectory\n",
    "depends on every control coefficient, so evaluating the gradient is\n",
    "computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another approach is to perform *state trajectory parameterization* in\n",
    "which the state trajectory is an optimization variable that is\n",
    "parameterized explicitly along with the control trajectory. A potential\n",
    "difficulty with this method is that enforcing dynamic constraints is\n",

    "\n",
    "### Handling infinite-horizon problems\n",

    "\n",
    "The second method is to reparameterize time so that the range\n",
    "$[0,\\infty)$ is transformed into a finite range, say $[0,1]$. If we let\n",
    "$s=1-e^t$ then $s$ is in the range $[0,1]$. The cost functional then\n",
    "becomes:\n",
    "$$J(x,u) = \\int_0^1 L(x(-\\ln(1-s)),u(-\\ln(1-s)),-\\ln(1-s)) / (1-s) ds.$$\n",
    "This leads to a finite-horizon optimal control problem over the $s$\n",
    "domain, with $T=1$. Hence, if a uniform grid is defined over\n",
    "$s \\in [0,1]$, then the grid spacing in the time domain becomes\n",
    "progressively large as $t$ increases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the reformulated problem it is necessary to express the derivative of\n",
    "$x$ with respect to $s$ in the new dynamics:\n",
    "$$\\frac{d}{d s} x(t(s)) = \\dot{x}(t(s)) t^\\prime(s) = f(x(t(s)),u(t(s))) / (1-s)$$\n",
    "Care must also be taken as $s$ approaches 1, since the $1/(1-s)$ term\n",
    "approaches infinity, and if instantaneous cost does not also approach 0,\n",
    "then cost will become infinite. It is therefore customary to use a\n",
    "discount factor. With an appropriately defined discount term, the $s=1$\n",
    "contribution to cost will be dropped.\n",

    "An alternative method to solve optimal control problems is to find the\n",
    "solution in *state space* rather than the time domain. In the\n",

    "\n",
    "We start by formulating the HJB equation in discrete time. Consider a\n",
    "finite-horizon optimal control problem, and define the *value function*\n",

    "$t$. (Obviously, $J(x,u)=J_0(x,u)$.)  Then, the value function is the minimizer of\n",
    "the truncated cost over all possible future controls: $V(x,t) = \\min_u(J_t(x,u))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is apparent that at time $T$, the only term that remains is the\n",
    "terminal cost, so one boundary term is given: $$V(x,T) = \\Phi(x).$$ Now\n",
    "we examine the value function going backwards in time. Suppose we know\n",

    "us also assume that at a state $x$ with control $u$, the resulting state\n",
    "at time $T$ is approximated by Euler integration, and the incremental\n",

    "we have the approximation\n",

    "\\label{eq:DiscreteTimeHJB}$$ The minimization is taken over controls to\n",

    "It is often useful to reduce the dimensionality down to an $n$-D grid if\n",

    "    is also known as recursive dynamic programming.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Linear programming uses a set of sample points $x_1,\\ldots,x_N$ on a\n",
    "    state space grid and points $u_1,\\ldots,u_M$ on a control space\n",
