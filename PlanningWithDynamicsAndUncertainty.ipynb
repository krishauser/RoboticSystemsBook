    "In the preceding discussion on kinematic path planning, we have not yet described how the computed paths could be followed.  In some cases, following a path is simple.  Suppose the robot could move forward and turn in place (e.g., a mobile robot with differential drive such as the iRobot Roomba, or a skid steer) any 2D polygonal path could be followed by a sequence of forward motions and turns. This strategy could also be followed by humanoid robots navigating indoors, simply by stepping along straight lines, turning in place when needed.  Similarly, there exist techniques for industrial robot arms to follow configuration-space paths created by sampling-based planners, as long as they do not move too quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more general cases, however, kinematic planning is not appropriate.  This chapter will discuss two issues that cannot be handled in the basic planning formulation described thus far, and require significant extensions to the basic discretize-and-search paradigm:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kinodynamic planning**.  In kinodynamic planning, the robot cannot simply move the state of the world in any direction it pleases.  Instead, it must also model the dynamics of the particular system.  Kinodynamic planning can also account for time-varying goals / costs and moving obstacles.  A related concept is known as _nonholonomic_ planning, which does not involve dynamics per se but also involves constraints on the derivative of the path.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Planning with uncertainty**. In many robotics applications, such as avoiding moving obstacles, a robot must integrate new information (feedback) from sensors and respond by changing its behavior.  There are two general approaches here: 1) replan a path taking the new information into account, 2) compute a more sophisticated type of plan -- a *policy* -- that predicts expected future errors and specifies how the robot should react.  The types of algorithms that are appropriate for handling [motion uncertainty](#Planning-under-imperfect-execution) are substantially different from those that handle [partial (missing) information](#Planning-under-partial-and-noisy-information), so we address them in separate sections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most real-world problems involve some elements of both of these challenges, with the challenges being especially acute in mobile robotics.  For example, to drive well in crowded environments, an autonomous vehicle needs to make fairly good predictions of other agents' behavior (potentially including how other agents will react with each other!) and incorporate these predictions into its plans."

It is allowed to fail for some inputs that cannot be connected.  This type of function is known as a *steering function*, and is very useful in kinodynamic planning.  For example, in a Dubins car problem, a steering function could use the [Reeds-Shepp curves](OptimalControl.ipynb#Bang-bang-control) to produce a dynamically-feasible path between any two states.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural approach, particularly in roadmap methods, is then to replace the straight-line connection primitive with the steering function.  The steered path can then be checked for collision, assessed for costs, etc.  A path connecting a series of milestones is then interpreted as using the steering function to interpolate between subsequent milestones.\n",

    "Although this approach performs well in practice, it requires a rather deep study to prove whether replacing straight-line connections with a particular steering function maintains completeness and optimality of a given planner.  A straight-line can be divided anywhere and the sum of lengths of the two sub-segments is exactly the same, but this property does not hold with steering functions.  For example, in the Dubins car case, the Reeds-Shepp paths produce \"parallel parking\" maneuvers for the car to move sideways, and over a distance a series of such maneuvers may be less effective than simply turning, moving forward, and turning back."

In kinodynamic planning, Euclidean distances between two states often correspond poorly with the length of paths between two states.  For example, moving sideways in a Dubins car requires performing \"parallel parking\" maneuvers that require moving a substantial distance forward and backward compared to the distance moved sideways.  This *metric sensitivity* problem is a well-known drawback of RRT, and many researchers have studied ways to improve the metric, including [LQR techniques from optimal control](OptimalControl.ipynb#LQR-control) and machine learning.\n",
    "- **Choose-Control**. The way in which controls are chosen has a strong effect on the speed and completeness of planning.

This optimization can be approximated by random sampling a few candidate controls and finding the one that gets the closest.  What is interesting is that although this approach tends to make rapid progress across free space, it does tend to get stuck with failure to progress.  Some authors have proven that in order for kinodynamic RRT to be probabilistically complete, it must sample controls at random.\n",

If a steering function were available, you could replace Line 9 with a test to see if $x_{e}$ could connect to the goal.  Or, once RRT finds a state $x_e$ that is \"close enough\" according to some threshold, it could then formulate a [trajectory optimization problem](OptimalControl.ipynb#Trajectory-Optimization) with fixed endpoints, and try to solve for a connecting path.\n"

Usually, robot's velocity constraints are expressed as bounded Euclidean norm $\\|\\dot{q}\\| \\leq v_{max}$, which can be written as a directional constraint.  The planner's objective is often to reach a goal $q_g$ within some time limit $T$, or to reach as close as possible to $q_g$ within the time limit.

The time limit in this example is is 4s, and the agent can only move at 2 units per second, so the agent doesn't reach the goal exactly. Instead, the goal is to minimize a weighted sum of path cost and final distance to goal.\n"

    "Another handy tool for planning amongst moving obstacles is the **velocity obstacles** concept (Figure 7).  The idea is that if an obstacle O were to be moving at a constant velocity, then we could calculate the set of constant robot velocities that would cause the robot to collide. This set of velocities is known as the velocity obstacle VO. \n",
    "\n",

    "<a name=\"fig:VelocityObstacles\"></a>\n",

    "\n",
    "<div class=\"figcaption\"><b>Figure 7</b>. Illustrating the velocity obstacles concept.  Top: For a static planar disk obstacle, $O$ any velocity ray that points toward $CO$ will eventually drive the robot into collision.  Hence, the velocity obstacle in $(\\dot{x},\\dot{y})$ space is a wedge. Bottom: If $O$ is moving at velocity $v$, then if the robot were also to be moving at velocity $v$, then it would look as though it were stationary.  Hence, the velocity obstacle *relative to a frame moving at velocity* $v$ is the same as in the static case. Shifting back to the standard reference frame, this results in the velocity obstacle being offset by $v$.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "\n",
    "If the robot simply chose its velocity to move as fast toward the target as possible, while not lying in VO for any obstacle O, then the robot would remain collision free as long as the objects do not change velocity. This is a local and relatively speedy calculation, so if the objects do change velocity, the robot can just recompute the new VOs and determine its best constant velocity again.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Using VOs directly can get a robot into trouble in a number of ways. If it gets close to an obstacle and the obstacle changes velocity, then it may need to rapidly adjust its velocity to avoid collision.  It could also become trapped by obstacles that change velocity, which could either cause a collision, or more benignly, failure to make progress (also known as deadlock). A variant of the VO idea is used in the popular [Reciprocal Velocity Obstacles](http://gamma.cs.unc.edu/RVO/) method (van den Berg et al, 2008), which guarantees that all agents will remain collision free if they all compute their velocity according to the RVO method. RVO has been used in crowd animation in movies and video games."

    "### Uncertain motion models\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, by assuming that we can predict exactly how obstacles behave in the future, our robot is going to act optimistically.  What if an obstacle changes direction?  Will our robot remain safe?  We can always replan if we observe the obstacle changing its path, but in some cases (especially in systems with inertia, like autonomous vehicles) we will have committed to a course of action that cannot be reversed!  Consider a pedestrian at a crosswalk. If we mistakenly predict that they will stop for us, and we decide to drive at high speed through the crosswalk, we might be going too fast to stop once we observe that they are deciding to proceed in front of us. Certainly we were overconfident in our prediction when we decided to keep our current rate of speed.

    "These models may indeed be too pessimistic, since the obstacles are free to choose the worst possible trajectories to stop the robot from advancing. The pessimism grows worse as the time horizon grows, as the robot becomes faced with progressively less room to maneuver. Imagine the worst-case when driving along a highway: all of a sudden, every other driver tries as best as they can to hit you. The only feasible solution would be not to drive at all!\n",
    "\n",
    "Less pessimistic models include *probabilistic models* that treat the obstacle movement as being related to a probabilistic random variable. For example,\n",

    "## Planning under imperfect execution\n",
    "\n",
    "The first type of uncertainty we shall consider is *motion uncertainty*, which means that as the robot executes a desired motion, its configuration may be knocked off course.  This type of uncertainty is a dominant factor in drones, underwater robots, and off-road driving, but exists for all robots to some extent.  The simplest way to account for motion uncertainty is using a path tracking feedback controller, which we shall study in more detail in [Chapter 13](RobotControl.ipynb#Trajectory-following).  But such a controller only makes local course corrections, and will not be cognizant of obstacles and other global information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a *replanning* approach, the robot simply recomputes plans every iteration, using the current observed state as the input. One severe issue with replanning is that the plan needs to be recomputed in real time (i.e, within a fixed time budget).  This budget is usually relatively small, say, one second or a fraction of a second.  We have already mentioned generate-and-score heuristics and potential fields as obstacle avoidance techniques that are typically quite computationally light, but are incomplete.  For low-dimensional problems like mobile robot navigation, replanning is not usually much of a problem, since geometric planners are usually quite fast. However, for industrial manipulators, legged robots, or multi-robot coordination, replanning may be much more computationally expensive.  In complex problems, to approach real-time replanning requires generating representations offline (i.e., precomputed before execution) that lead to fast replanning online (i.e., during execution).  For example, PRM can be precomputed for a given environment, and the optimal path between any two points in this environment can be computed quickly using search. The Dynamic Window approach described below is a hybrid approach that precomputes a well-designed, global navigation function, and replans local, dynamically-feasible paths to descend this function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative to replanning is to precompute the appropriate way to react to *any* future disturbance. This calls for replacing our search-based model of planning with a different planning paradigm, which is known as the Markov Decision Process (MDP).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Navigation functions and the Dynamic Window Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "A useful application of grid search is to compute a *navigation function* that, for each configuration $q$, outputs the cost of the shortest path to reach the goal starting at $q$.  This gives a reasonable estimate of long-range navigation cost for dynamic mobile robots or even legged robots. \n",
    "\n",
    "A navigation function on a grid G can be computed by running Dijkstra's algorithm backward, starting from the goal.  This operates in a \"brush fire\" manner that grows uniform-cost fringes around the goal node. We do not terminate when the algorithm reaches the start state, but rather let the algorithm propagate to all reachable states.  Then, for each node $v$ the navigation function stores the cost $c(v)$ from the goal to the node, which by symmetry is exactly the cost from the node to the goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantage of this approach is that the navigation function can be solved once and cached.  Then, the optimal action at each state $x$ is the direction that descends the navigation function the fastest, i.e., $x$ should move toward $\\arg \\min_{v \\in N(x)} c(v)$, where $N(x)$ gives the nodes of the grid in some neighborhood of $x.$  If the robot is knocked off of its course, then it can simply examine the navigation function value at its new location, only having to check for the local node with minimum value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because a mobile robot may have orientation and velocity, the navigation function value is not perfect particularly locally, where it may need to perform backing up and turning maneuvers.  In the long run, however, the robot moves approximately like a point traveling at constant speed.  So, a very practical approach is to generate short local trajectories that accurately respect the dynamic behavior of the robot, including inertia, acceleration limits, and turning limits, but measure the progress of each trajectory toward achieving long-term goals using the navigation function value at its endpoint.  Collisions along those trajectories should also be checked to reject infeasible motions, and the trajectory is chosen that minimizes a combination of short-term and long-term costs.  This is a form of the [generate-and-score heuristic](WhatIsMotionPlanning.ipynb#Generate-and-score) described earlier.  More precisely, the DWA algorithm follows psuedocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. (Offline) Run Dijkstra's algorithm on the configuration space grid $G$, backwards from the goal, to generate a navigation function $f(v)$ for all $v \\in G$.\n",
    "2. (Online) Generate dynamically-feasible paths $y_1,\\ldots,y_N$ starting at the current state $x$.  Various methods like random sampling or motion primitives can be used here. \n",
    "3. (Online) Score the paths and choose the path $y^*$ with the best score.  The scoring function should use the navigation function to estimate the cost to reach the goal, but can also incorporate other factors, such as preferences for low-curvature paths, etc.  Specifically, the navigation function is evaluated at the closest grid point to the end of the path $y_i(s_i)$, where the domain of $y_i$ is $[0,s_i]$.\n",
    "4. (Online) Execute a small portion of $y^*$, sense the robot's new state, and repeat from Step 2.\n",

    "Looking closely at the Dubins car DWA example above, some of the curves appear to pass very close to obstacles.  This would be dangerous if the robot were not able to perfectly execute the generated paths, e.g. with wheel slippage or uneven ground.  In the below figure, the DWA planner was used exactly in the same way, but at each time step, a random disturbance to the movement direction was introduced.  This shows that with disturbances, the overly optimistic navigation function can cause replanning with DWA to collide into obstacles (red paths) or fail to reach the goal (yellow paths)."

    "The DWA approach does not predict the future effects of uncertainty that might push the robot off course.  A simple way of handling some of this uncertainty is to include the prediction uncertainty into the scoring function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that when the planner generates a path, the robot can't predict exactly where it would end up after executing it, or whether it would hit an obstacle.  But having uncertainty doesn't mean \"having no information\": the robot is unlikely to hop across the environment, or to be spun 180° in a single step.  The actual path driven $y_{act}$ will be fairly close to the planned path $y_{plan}$, with some increasing spread as we go along.  A scoring function that quantifies the effect of this increasing spread is known as a *robust score*. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can quantify the spread by generating many hypothesized \"futures\" for the planned path, using *random sampling* to simulate the effect of uncertainty.  This type of approach is called a *Monte-Carlo method*.  Here we describe the basic function of the method without going too deep into detail about its probabilistic foundations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using a random number generator, we generate (sample) $N$ perturbed trajectories that might be possible realizations of $y_{act}$.  The disturbance along the trajectory varies over the length of the trajectory, so it is assumed to be a function $\\epsilon(s)$.  Specifically, let us assume that $y$ is comprised of $M$ time steps generated by a simulation function $h$, so that repeated application of $h(x,u)$ generates the planned path.  Specifically, let the planned trajectory $y_{plan}$ be a piecewise-linear interpolation of an array of states $x_{plan}[0],\\ldots,x_{plan}[M]$ associated with controls $u_{plan}[0],\\ldots,u_{plan}[M-1]$ such that $x_{plan}[i+1] = h(x_{plan}[i],u_{plan}[i])$. Then, we sample a perturbed trajectory by rolling out the simulation function plus a disturbance vector $\\delta_x$ sampled at random.  Each element of the disturbance is generated in a localized spread around 0, e.g., a uniform distribution in the range $[-\\sigma,\\sigma]$ or a normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\\sigma$.  Most e.g., Python's `random.uniform` or `random.gauss` functions.  Then, we generate the perturbed trajectory $y_{samp}$ as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. $x_{samp}[0] = x_{plan}[0]$.\n",
    "2. For $k=0,...,M-1$, do:\n",
    "   3. Sample a new value of $\\delta_x$\n",
    "   4. $x_{samp}[k+1] = h(x_{act}[k],u_{plan}[k]) + \\delta_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the overall error is an accumulation of multiple perturbations $\\delta_x$.\n",
    "\n",
    "One common robust scoring function is the expected score (average score), which is approximated by the average score over $N$ samples.  Letting $y_{samp}^1,\\ldots,y_{samp}^N$ denote the $N$ samples around $y_{plan}$, this is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{avg} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{k=1}^N S(y_{samp}^k).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Another possibility is to choose the maximum score, which (assuming the score should be minimized) encourages the robot to stay further away from \"dangerous\" areas that the robot might arrive at, but with low probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{max} = \\max_{k=1}^N S(y_{samp}^k).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar effect is achieved using a *confidence bound*.  Defining $S_{std}$ as the standard deviation of the score, approximated using the samples as follows\n",
    "\n",
    "$$S_{std} = \\left( \\frac{1}{N-1} \\sum_{k=1}^N (S(y_{samp}^k)- S_{avg})^2 \\right)^{1/2},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "we define an upper confidence interval of the score as the average value penalized with the standard deviation, scaled by the parameter $\\eta$:\n",
    "$$S_{conf,\\eta} = S_{avg} + \\eta S_{std}.$$\n",
    "The signficance of this formula is that $\\eta$ increases, the likelihood that the actual score exceeds $S_{conf,\\eta}$ decreases (rather sharply).  Assuming scores are normally distributed and $N$ is sufficiently large, we have\n",
    "- $P(S(y_{act}) \\geq S_{conf,\\eta=0}) = 50\\%$\n",
    "- $P(S(y_{act}) \\geq S_{conf,\\eta=1}) \\approx 15.9\\%$\n",
    "- $P(S(y_{act}) \\geq S_{conf,\\eta=2}) \\approx 2.3\\%$\n",
    "- $P(S(y_{act}) \\geq S_{conf,\\eta=3}) \\approx 0.1\\%$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure below shows the use of robust scoring in DWA.  Because colliding with obstacles is penalized, the method chooses paths that swing farther around the obstacles.  Note that compared to plain DWA, the computation time scales by a factor of $N$ (in this case, $N=20$).  To run this on-board a real robot at a reasonable rate, such as 10Hz, the code would need to be optimized or parallelized.  Fortunately, Monte Carlo sampling is trivially parallelizable."

    "\n",
    "A second problem with the standard DWA approach is that the navigation function is constructed under the erroneous assumption that the robot can move precisely and instantaneously in any direction.  When the robot is at a grid point $(x,y)$, it has some orientation $\\theta$ that can't be entirely predicted at the time of constructing the navigation function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A Markov Decision Process (MDP) is a principled method for representing decision-making problems under probabilistic movement uncertainty.  Using MDPs, we can calculate safer navigation functions that give suitable trade-offs between optimality and collision risk.  MDPs are also general-purpose, so they have been useful in modeling uncertainty in obstacle motion, wind gusts for UAVs, traffic delays, human behavior, as well as many other applications outside of robotics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Simple example\n",
    "\n",
    "In a discrete state space, an MDP can be thought of as a probabilistic extension of a discrete search problem, where after each action, the system doesn't just arrive at a single state, but could arrive with some probability at multiple states.  First, an MDP requires defining a state space $S$ and an *action space* $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us start with a very simple example to illustrate the basic principles of MDPs (while also exploring some moral philosophy while we're at it!)  Let there be three states Alive, Heaven, and Hell. The robot starts at Alive, wants to arrive at Heaven, and does not want to arrive at Hell.  There are two actions, Mild and Wild, corresponding to how conservatively the robot chooses to live its life.  After choosing an action it will arrive at another state, or possibly the same state, according to the following rules.  If it chooses Mild, then there is a 90% chance of staying at Alive, and a 10% chance of arriving at Heaven.  If it chooses Wild, there is a 60% chance of arriving at Heaven, and 40% chance of arriving at Hell.  Once arriving at Heaven and Hell, the robot is done, but if it chooses Mild, there is some chance that it will stay Alive.  How, then, should the robot choose its actions? \n",

    "<div class=\"figcaption\"><b>Figure 12</b>. A very simple Markov Decision Process. States are indicated with ellipses, and decisions are indicated with boxes. Heaven and Hell are terminal states.  Rewards of each state are designated in blue.  The value of choosing Wild in the Alive state is the probability-weighted average of the two terminal rewards.  The value of choosing Mild is the probability-weighted average of the terminal reward of Heaven and the value of Alive.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "************\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, there is a final missing ingredient in this formulation, which is the idea of a *reward function*.  The reward function $R$ allows us to assign a numerical score for a sequence of states and actions.  Let's suppose that arriving in Heaven has reward 100, Hell has reward -100, and staying Alive has reward of -1.  Then, the  expected (average) reward of choosing Wild while alive is 60-40% average of the rewards of arriving at Heaven and Hell, which is to say, $P(Heaven | Alive,Wild)\\cdot R(Heaven) + P(Hell | Alive,Wild) \\cdot R(Hell) = 0.6 \\cdot 100 + 0.4 \\cdot (-100) = 20$. Since after this, the robot is dead, we can't hope to get any more reward thereafter.  Let's call this expected value $Q(Alive,Wild)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to assess the quality of the Mild action, it's a bit trickier, because there is a possibility for the state to stay the same (this is called a self-loop).  Over just the next step, the expected reward is $P(Heaven | Alive,Mild)\\cdot R(Heaven) + P(Alive | Alive,Mild)\\cdot R(Alive) = 0.1\\cdot 100 + 0.9\\cdot(-1) = 10-0.9 = 9.1$.  At the moment, this doesn't look any better than Wild.  But if the robot stays alive, it can choose additional actions and collect additional reward.  This sum of rewards is called a *return*.  Note, however, that the robot is able to change the action that it chooses from Mild to Wild, or stay the same.  The robot should consider the *best* possible action, that is, the one with the best expected return.  Specifically, the best possible expected return $V(Alive)$ at Alive is the one that maximises expected return amongst the two choices:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V(Alive) = \\max (Q(Alive,Mild), Q(Alive,Wild)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where we haven't set solved for $Q(Alive,Mild)$.  We can set up a recursive equation that depends on $V(Alive)$:\n",
    "$$Q(Alive,Mild) = P(Heaven | Alive,Mild)\\cdot R(Heaven) + P(Alive | Alive,Mild)\\cdot (R(Alive) + V(Alive))  = 9.1 + 0.9 V(Alive).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then consider which of the two actions maximizes the $\\max$ term in $V(Alive)$. If the best action were Wild, then $V(Alive) = Q(Alive,Wild) = 20$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Q(Alive,Mild) = 9.1 + 0.9\\cdot 20 = 27.1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks pretty promising!  On the other hand, if the best choice were to be Mild, then we have a recursive equation:\n",
    "$$Q(Alive,Mild) = 9.1 + 0.9 Q(Alive,Mild).$$\n",
    "Rearranging, we get $0.1 \\cdot Q(Alive,Mild) = 9.1$, and dividing both sides by 0.1, we obtain $Q(Alive,Mild) = 91$. Ah, much better!  Since Mild is the better option, $V(Alive)$ is actually equal to $Q(Alive,Mild)$, and Mild is the optimal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now what would happen if robot received a reward of -10 for staying alive (say, it felt miserable cleaning up after humans)?  Then the calculus changes.  Repeating the above calculations, the value of 9.1 becomes only 1, and then $Q(Alive,Mild)$ becomes the maximum of 19 (choosing Wild thereafter) and 10 (choosing Mild thereafter).  This shows that Wild is the better choice, and $V(Alive)$ is equal to $Q(Alive,Wild)$ (which remains 20).  In general, the MDP decision model can obtain a very rich set of behaviors that balances uncertainty and action-dependent rewards. It is no wonder that MDPs are used throughout economics and behavioral sciences!  (Despite the seeming usefulness of MDPs in modeling metaphysical decisions about the afterlife in this example, they still haven't made much headway into the study of theology... how curious!)"

Suppose we have a robot moving on a grid $G=(V,E)$, and every time it tries to move from one grid cell to an adjacent cell, it has some probability (say, 10%) of spinning its wheels and staying in place.  We can model this as the state space $S = V$, and an action space of up, down left, and right (denoted $A = \\{ n, s, w, e \\}$ like the compass directions).  When the robot is at a grid point $s=(i,j)$ and choses an action $a \\in A$, there is some grid point $(i+\\delta_{i,a},j+\\delta_{j,a})$ offset by 1 on some axis that it would arrive at with 90% probability.  The robot would stay at the same grid point $(i,j)$ with 10% probability.  Letting $s^\\prime$ denote the actual state that the robot arrives at, the MDP model states that the probability that $s^\\prime = (i+\\delta_{i,a},j+\\delta_{j,a})$ is 0.9, and the probability that $s^\\prime = s$ is 0.1.\n",

These MDPs are known as *sparse*.  For sparse MDPs, it is more computationally efficient to optimize only over the set of applicable states, and sum over the states for which the transition probability is nonzero.  To do so, we denote a subset of applicable actions $Appl(s) \\subseteq A$ that are allowed to be applied in state $s$, and a subset of *successor states* $Succ(s,a) \\subseteq S$ for which $s^\\prime \\in Succ(s,a)$ iff $T(s,a,s^\\prime) \\neq 0$.

    "\n",
    "Roughly speaking, there are two types of MDP that prevent this type of degeneracy:\n",
    "1. Regardless of the choice of actions, the robot will eventually reach a terminal state with probability 1.\n",
    "2. Two conditions must hold: a) From any state, there is a nonzero probability of reaching a terminal state with some sequence of actions. b) All rewards are negative, except for those arriving at a terminal state.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Type 1 MDPs, the probability that the robot doesn't terminate after $t$ steps decreases toward 0, so the rewards obtained after $t$ steps shrinks.  In Type 2 MDPs, there may be some policies that keep the robot into an infinite loop, but since all rewards are negative, infinite-looping policies will not be optimal.  (To make the argument precise, several technical conditions must be met, e.g., rewards are finite, and the number of states are finite.)\n",

    "In other types of MDPs that don't satisfy these conditions, we can enforce the existence of a solution using slight modifications of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Discounting**.  The MDP defined above is called an *undiscounted* MDP.  It is common to consider *discounted* MDPs where future rewards are reduced in value the later they are received.  This approach causes the robot to prefer shorter-term rewards over equivalent long-term rewards.  The most common *geometric discounting* method replaces the undiscounted return $\\eqref{eq:Return}$ with the discounted return\n",

    "One reason why geometric discounting is so popular is that it leads to extremely mathematically-convenient expressions for the discounted value of a policy and the discounted Bellman equation.

We will also define the length-$|S|$ reward vector $\\mathbf{r}$ where the entry corresponding to $s$ is $\\sum_{s^\\prime \\in S} T(s,\\pi(s),s^\\prime) R(s,\\pi(s),s^\\prime)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this definition, it can be seen that the expression $\\eqref{eq:DiscountedValueOfPolicy}$ of the value function can be written as\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{r} + \\gamma T_\\pi \\mathbf{v}.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "By rearranging, we get the expression\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "(I - \\gamma T_\\pi) \\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{r}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "and if $I - \\gamma T_\\pi$ is invertible, we can solve via matrix inversion:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\mathbf{v} = (I - \\gamma T_\\pi)^{-1} \\mathbf{r}.\n",
    "\\label{eq:MDPInversion}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "In the undiscounted ($\\gamma=1$) case, $T_\\pi$ may contain some entries with value 1, e.g., terminal states have 1 on the diagonal.  So, showing that $(I - T_\\pi)\\mathbf{v} = \\mathbf{r}$ has a solution is rather non-trivial and requires assumptions about the structure of $T_\\pi$.  However, in the discounted ($\\gamma < 1$) case, every entry of $\\gamma T_\\pi$ is in the range $[0,\\gamma]$ (and also $[0,1)$).  Moreover, each row of $T_\\pi$ sums to 1, so the sum of the values of row $s$ minus the diagonal is just $1-T_\\pi[s,s]$.  Hence, considering row $s$ of $I - \\gamma T_\\pi$, the diagonal entry is $1 - \\gamma T_\\pi[s,s]$, and the off-diagonal entries sum to $-\\gamma (1-T_\\pi[s,s])$.  Since $1 - \\gamma T_\\pi[s,s] > \\gamma (1-T_\\pi[s,s])$, the matrix is strictly diagonally dominant, which implies that it has an inverse.\n",

    "**Finite-horizon solving**. This approach simply forces the robot to terminate automatically after $N$ steps, which turns the infinite-horizon MDP problem into a finite-horizon one.  The typical approach for formulating a finite-horizon so by *time-stamping* the state.  Essentially, a time-stamped problem creates an augmented state space $\\tilde{S}$ where each element is a (state,time) pair $(s,t)$ with $s\\in S$.  The transition function always moves one time step ahead, so that $\\tilde{T}((s,t),a,(s^\\prime,t+1)) = T(s,a,s^\\prime)$ and $\\tilde{T}((s,t),a,(s^\\prime,t^\\prime)) = 0$ for any $t^\\prime \\neq t+1$.  The goal set is also augmented: $\\tilde{G} = \\{ (s,t) \\,|\\, s\\in G \\text{ or }t = N \\}$.  The augmented MDP $(\\tilde{S},A,\\tilde{T},R,\\tilde{G})$ satisfies the Type 1 condition.\n",

    "* Another termination criterion, rather than running for a fixed number of steps, terminates when no entry of $V^t$ and $V^{t+1}$ exceeds a threshold $\\epsilon$.  If the maximum reward $R_{max}$ is known and $\\gamma < 1$, choosing $N > \\log \\epsilon / \\log \\gamma $ suffices.\n",
    "* The computational complexity of value iteration is $O(|S|^2 |A| N)$.  This can be reduced to $O(|S| |A| N)$ if it is known that after each action, the probability of transition is nonzero for $O(1)$ states.  It can also be completed in $O(|S|)$ space complexity, by swapping the storage of $V^t$ and $V^{t-1}$ at each iteration.\n",

    "#### Policy iteration\n",
    "\n",
    "The second most popular MDP solution technique is *policy iteration* (PI).  Its motivation is that the value function estimates computed by VI will still change, even when the optimal actions determined by $\\eqref{eq:OptimalPolicy}$ have already converged.  So, it focuses on iterating over better policies $\\pi$, and using $\\eqref{eq:MDPInversion}$ to determine the value of the policy. Its pseudocode is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "****************\n",
    "<a name=\"alg:PolicyIteration\"></a>\n",
    "**Algorithm Policy Iteration**\n",
    "1. Guess a policy $\\pi$, and set $changed$ to true.\n",
    "2. While $changed$ = true, repeat:\n",
    "3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculate the value of policy $\\pi$: $ \\mathbf{v} = (I - \\gamma T_\\pi)^{-1} \\mathbf{r}. $\n",
    "4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $changed \\gets$ false.\n",
    "5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For all states $s\\in S$, update the best action:\n",
    "6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calculate $v[a] \\gets \\sum_{s^\\prime} T(s,a,s^\\prime) (R(s,a,s^\\prime) + V_\\pi(s^\\prime))$ for all $a$.\n",
    "7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If $v[\\pi(s)] \\neq \\max_{a\\in A} v[a]$\n",
    "8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Set $\\pi(s) \\gets \\arg \\max_{a\\in A} v[a]$\n",
    "9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $changed \\gets$ true\n",
    "10. Return $\\pi$\n",
    "***************************\n",
    "\n",
    "Line 3 uses matrix inversion $\\eqref{eq:MDPInversion}$ to calculate the true value of the current policy. If $T_\\pi$ is a sparse matrix (which is a typical case), then sparse matrix techniques can be used to solve this equation quickly, possibly as low as $O(|S|)$ time.  Lines 6--9 update the best action for state $s$ and mark whether the policy has changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "PI can be proven to converge to the optimal policy in a finite number of iterations.  The gist of the proof is to first observe that the only case in which the policy remains unchanged during an iteration is if the policy is optimal. Second, we show that PI will never proceed in an infinite loop of suboptimal policies.  There are a finite number of possible policies ($|S|^{|A|}$) and there is no way that a policy will ever be obtained at a later iteration.  Hence, it will encounter an optimal policy in no more than $|S|^{|A|}$ iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The example below shows policy iteration applied to the same problem.  Note that in very few iterations, the policy converges to optimal.  However, each iteration is somewhat more expensive than value iteration, and the overall running time is approximately the same."

    "#### Application to robust navigation functions\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use MDPs to compute a robust navigation function that takes into account the robot's motion uncertainty.  Again, an error rate of 25% is added to the transition function.  Since the grid is 100x100, there are 10,000 states in the MDP and 8 actions per state.  As a result, value iteration is much slower than in the above examples, and policy iteration takes 10s of seconds to complete.  Nevertheless, observe in the figure below that the navigation function now has rings of higher cost around the obstacles, which will encourage the robot to move around obstacles with more clearance.  In particular, the navigation function now tells the robot to go around the narrow passage rather than through it to avoid the risk of colliding.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second plot shows how standard DWA, using the robust navigation function in the scoring function, is also able to reject disturbances by staying closer to the center of hallways.  This comes at some expense of taking somewhat longer paths.  Note that DWA remains fast because it does not use any extra sampling to estimate scores like the probabilistic scoring function did; all of the reasoning about uncertainty has been pushed to the precomputation phase."

Approach 2 and 3 are software focused, and although approach 3 is hypothetically a more principled approach to the problem, we will not be able to cover these approaches within the scope of this book (we will discuss why in [Section 4.4](#Information-space-and-many-worlds-interpretation).  So, let us say a few words about Approach 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of probabilistic costs is simply to assign a cost that is high when paths pass close to obstacles and low when they do not.  Specifically, a sensible choice is to assign a cost based on the negative *log-likelihood* of segment feasibility:\n",
    "$$c(a,b) = -\\log P\\left(\\overline{ab} \\subset \\mathcal{F}\\right).$$\n",

    "Of course, the collision status of each edge is not independent, but this is a fair approximation because in the cases that we typically care about, the robot doesn't take on too much risk of collision, and the approximation is better when there are fewer chances to collide.\n",
    "\n",
    "To assess the log collision probability, we can use a probabilistic model of the error of measuring each obstacle. If $O$ is the true workspace obstacle, and our measurement provides us with an estimate $\\hat{O}$, we could model the probability $P(O\\subseteq \\hat{O}_\\delta)$ that $O$ lies within a version of $\\hat{O}$ dilated by distance $\\delta$.  For example, if the sensor noise is roughly a zero-mean Gaussian distribution with standard deviation $\\sigma$, we could model $P(O\\subseteq \\hat{O}_\\delta) = \\Phi(\\delta/\\sigma)$ where $\\Phi$ is the c.d.f. of the unit Gaussian distribution.  As the dilation $\\delta$ grows large, this probability approaches 1, and as the dilation shrinks, the probability approaches 0.  (Note that this is an extremely simplified model of how sensor noise affects the shape of obstacles, but for most robotics applications is produces reasonable results.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, the probability that $\\overline{ab} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is related to the workspace clearance of the robot as it traverses $\\overline{ab}$. If the clearance from $\\hat{O}$ is $\\epsilon$, then the probability that $\\overline{ab} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ is simply modeled as $\\Phi(\\delta/\\sigma)$.  The edge cost would then be set to $-\\log \\Phi(\\delta/\\sigma)$.  (Note that this can be approximated extremely well by the cheaper function $0.115\\max\\left(0,-\\frac{\\delta}{\\sigma}+2\\right)^{2.5}$.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this approach is that it may take extremely long paths, so instead the cost is usually set to some weighted sum of movement cost and log probability of feasibility, e.g. $c(a,b) = w\\|a-b\\| - \\log P(\\overline{ab}\\subset \\mathcal{F})$. A minimum-cost path will therefore trade off between efficiency of execution and likelihood of collision.  "

    "### Active sensing\n",
    "\n",
    "*Active sensing* problems require the robot to choose its actions deliberately to gather information\n",
    "in order to complete its task.  For example, for inspection problems, or building a map of an unknown\n",
    "environment, the objective itself is to gather data. To use a utensil in an unknown kitchen, the robot\n",
    "must first find the utensil by opening drawers and cabinets.  In these cases, an effective strategy\n",
    "for planning is to 1) quantify the *information gain* from a hypothetical state in a manner that\n",
    "can be used in the planner's scoring function, and 2) allow the planner to choose between multiple\n",
    "goals, picking the one that best balances the value of information, overall task achievement, and\n",
    "movement cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Pure information gathering\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us first consider the problem of map-building, which is a pure information gathering problem. Let\n",
    "us assume a 2D problem with a mobile robot with a configuration space $\\mathcal{C}$ in SE(3), with configuration $q=(x,y,\\theta)$.  Let $M$ be a partial map, given by a 2D probabilistic occupancy grid.  The map defines\n",
    "$M(x,y) = 1$ if the workspace\n",
    "point $x,y$ is *occupied* by an obstacle, $M(x,y) = 0$ if the point is known to be *free*, and $M(x,y) = 0.5$\n",
    "if its contents are *unknown*.  As the robot moves, the map is updated using some mapping algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the robot has a sweeping laser sensor mounted on its center, pointed in its forward direction, and it has\n",
    "an angular range of $\\pm \\theta_{max}$. Each scan provides $N$ readings within the angular range, and the maximum\n",
    "distance is $d_{max}$.  Using this sensor model, we can predict how much of the map's unexplored boundary can be sensed from a new configuration $q$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At $q$, each laser scan ray emanates from $(x,y)$ with heading $\\theta + \\theta_{laser,i}$, with $\\theta_{laser,i} = -\\theta_{max} + 2 (i-1) / (N-1) \\theta{max}$, for $i=1,\\ldots,N$.  At points $p_1,p_2,...,$ along this ray, we walk along the occupancy grid, up to distance $d_{max}$, and evaluate the contents of the map $M(p_j)$.  If we meet a point that is occupied or unknown ($M(p_j)=0.5$ or 1), we stop.  If we stop only by hitting the robot's sensor range $d_{max}$, or $M(p_j)$ is occupied, then the ray is not expected to provide any information at $q$.  If $M(p_j)$ is unknown, then we can expect for this ray to provide the robot with new information about the shape of the map.  As a result, we can define an information gain score as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f_{inf}(q) = \\text{# of rays that see an unknown cell at }q.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In essence, this score says that each ray that hits an unknown cell gives 1 unit of information, and rays that hit obstacles or terminate at the max sensor range give 0 units. A slight refinement of this score might promote the robot to get closer to the unknown cells so that more free space could potentially be added to the map.  For example, if a ray sees an unknown cell, we could contribute $d_{max} - \\|p_j - (x,y)\\|$ to the score as an optimistic guess that the ray would be completely clear at that point.\n",
    "\n",
    "In any case, this score can now be used for planning.  Any configuration with nonzero $f_{inf}(q)$ is now a candidate for a goal, which means we have a *goal set* rather than a single configuration.  Moreover, we need to pick amongst the goals, and trade off between configurations that are nearby vs those with high $f_{inf}(q)$.  Let $f_{move}(y)$ be the movement cost of a path $y:[0,T] \\rightarrow \\mathcal{F}$.  We would like to find paths that have high $f_{inf}$ at the terminal state and low $f_{move}$.  One straightforward approach is to define the score of a path $y$ as the *rate of information gain*, \n",
    "$$s(y) = f_{inf}(y(T)) / f_{move}(y),$$\n",
    "with higher values better.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this cost is *not additive*, which means that it cannot be expressed as a standard sum of edge costs in a graph $G$.  But, the maximum score over all paths to some goal configuration $q$ is equal to $\\max_{y\\in G |y(T)=q} s(y) = f_{inf}(q) / g^*(q_{cur},q)$, where $g^*(q_{cur},q)$ is the shortest path from $q_{cur}$ to $q$.  Hence, we can solve this problem by the following two-step procedure:\n",
    "1. Create a graph $G=(V,E)$ using some roadmap method (a grid or a PRM). Search the graph to produce shortest paths $g^*(q)$ to all vertices $q\\in V$.\n",
    "2. Loop over all vertices to find the goal $q$ with maximum  $f_{inf}(q)/g^*(q)$. Output the shortest path to the best goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are no goal nodes with positive rate of information gain, then either there is no more unexplored area in the map, or the resolution of the graph was not set finely enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this approach generates high-quality paths given the current state of information, but only assesses how much information can be gathered at a single goal state.  As a result, it is referred to as a *greedy information-gain* approach.  In this example, there is no information loss, and the robot will never reach a dead-end from which it cannot escape, so greedy information gain will indeed suffice to build the map.  \n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Figure 18: illustrate greedy information gain / poor cases \n",
    "\n",
    "However, greedy information gain may not be the most efficient approach, as there may be sequences of information-gain actions that are more efficient at acquiring information in the long run. An example is illustrated below. \n",
    "More sophisticated searches can consider multiple information-gathering actions, but also need to model how the each information-gathering step changes the robot's information state.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mixed information gathering and task achievement\n",
    "\n",
    "In a more complex task, a robot may need to trade off between acquiring information needed to complete the task and accomplishing the task itself.  To find a professor's office in a new building, a student would either find a directory or a receptionist, find the office number, possibly ask for directions, and then seek the office.  A robot in pure information-gain mode would start by mapping out the entire building!  In this case, the robot should be able to determine 1) is there enough information to complete the task, 2) if the task can only be achieved partially or probabilistically, should I continue gathering information or attempt to complete some of the task? \n",
    "\n",
    "Deciding what to do in the first case can be addressed by a simple heuristic; if there is no chance to complete the task with the current information, perform information gathering.  As soon as enough information is available to complete the task, do it.  This heuristic performs adequately in some cases, but it does not *direct its information gathering toward accomplishing the task*.  If you lost a contact lens, would it make sense to start mapping out the walls?\n",
    "\n",
    "The strategy of *task-driven* information gain requires defining a new score that takes the likelihood of task achievement into account rather than the mere quantity of information gathered. For most problem settings this likelihood cannot be evaluated analytically, since it would, in essense, involve solving a planning problem for every possible world (see [the section below](#Information-space-and-many-worlds-interpretation)). Instead, task-relevance"
