    "Articulated robots are an example of a second order dynamic system, and\n",

    "configuration variable has a corresponding control variable. In other\n",
    "words, $n = 2m$, since the state variable $x=(q,\\dot{q})$ is the phase\n",
    "of the system, and the control $u$ is assumed to affect the rate of\n",
    "change of $\\dot{q}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of trajectory following is to define a desired joint\n",
    "space trajectory $q_D(t)$ and to have the robot's actual trajectory\n",
    "$q(t)$ follow it. Assuming the robot can precisely measure its\n",
    "configuration and velocity, the general method for doing so is simply to\n",
    "send the desired configuration $q_D(t)$ and velocity and $\\dot{q}_D(t)$\n",
    "to a lower level controller, such as a PID controller, while updating\n",
    "the setpoint at a sufficiently high rate. However, to obtain accurate\n",
    "tracking, the designer of the trajectory must be cognizant of the\n",
    "control performance of the robot as a second order system, since at the\n",
    "lowest level the motor controller must eventually convert setpoint\n",
    "commands into joint torques.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, discontinuities in $q_D(t)$ should be forbidden since the robot\n",
    "will accelerate quickly, and possibly overshoot the target. Similarly,\n",
    "discontinuities in $\\dot{q}_D(t)$ should be avoided if possible, because\n",
    "exact tracking would require instantaneous acceleration. Naïvely\n",
    "requesting sudden changes of velocity runs the risk of overheating\n",
    "motors and overshooting setpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, joint stops and self-collision should be avoided with some\n",
    "margin of error, since the controller will not execute the trajectory\n",
    "exactly, especially at high speed. The magnitude of the margins should\n",
    "be chosen proportionally to the magnitude of control errors, which\n",
    "depend on the stiffness of the underlying controller.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several functions that a motor controller may provide to\n",

    "command). Over time, the controller will execute the requested\n",

    "external request signal (e.g., a function call). For example, adding a\n",
    "Go-To request will append an interpolating curve from the end of the\n",
    "queued trajectory to the requested target position (a *waypoint*). If\n",
    "the current queue is empty, then the curve will originate from the\n",
    "current robot position. This type of asynchronous request is convenient\n",

    "##### General methods and cubic curves\n",
    "\n",
    "Other potential interpolation profiles include cubic curves (Hermite\n",
    "interpolation) and sinusoidal curves (cosine smoothing). In each case,\n",
    "coefficients of the profile and the interpolation duration are\n",
    "determined by matching the boundary conditions and any operational\n",
    "constraints on the velocity or acceleration of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a cubic curve $\\theta(u)$ interpolating between $\\theta_s$\n",
    "and $\\theta_g$ over the range $u\\in [0,1]$ has the form\n",

    "Using the boundary conditions $\\theta(0) = \\theta_s$,\n",
    "$\\theta(1) = \\theta_g$, $\\theta'(0) = 0$, and $\\theta'(1)=0$, we have\n",
    "four linear constraints that must be satisfied: $a=0$, $a+b+c+d=1$,\n",
    "$b = 0$, and $b + 2c + 3d = 0$. The solution is $a=0$, $b=0$, $c=3$,\n",
    "$d=-2$, and hence\n",
    "$$\\theta(u) = \\theta_s + (\\theta_g-\\theta_s)(3u^2 - 2u^3)$$ is a smooth\n",
    "interpolator known as the Hermite curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "The remaining question is how to set the time duration of the curve\n",
    "$t_f$ to maintain velocity and acceleration limits. We define\n",
    "$u = t/t_f$, giving the expression for velocity\n",
    "$$\\dot{\\theta}(t) = \\frac{d}{dt} \\theta(u(t)) = \\theta^\\prime(u(t)) u^\\prime(t) =  (\\theta_g-\\theta_s)(6u - 6u^2) /t_f = 6(\\theta_g-\\theta_s)(t/t_f^2 - t^2/t_f^3)$$\n",
    "This is maximized at $t=t_f/2$, which gives the maximum velocity along\n",
    "the curve as a function of $t_f$\n",
    "$$v^\\star(t_f) = \\frac{3}{2}(\\theta_g-\\theta_s)/t_f.$$ The acceleration\n",
    "is $$\\ddot{\\theta}(t) = 6(\\theta_g-\\theta_s)(1/t_f^2 - 2t/t_f^3)$$ which\n",
    "has maximum absolute value at the endpoints. Hence, the maximum\n",
    "acceleration along the curve is is\n",
    "$$a^\\star(t_f) = 6(\\theta_g-\\theta_s)/t_f^2.$$ It is then a simple\n",
    "matter to determine whether the curve is acceleration limited or\n",
    "velocity limited, and then to set $t_f$ appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Speed and velocity control\n",
    "\n",
    "Speed control is a fairly common addition for Go-To commands, and simply\n",
    "modulates the rate of progression of \"time\" along the trajectory.\n",
    "However, to avoid sudden changes in velocity it is important not to\n",
    "modify path speed instantaneously while the robot is moving.\n",
    "Alternatively, speed control may be provided by modulating the maximum\n",
    "velocity / acceleration used to derive the interpolation profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Velocity control is a desirable capability for maximizing robot speed\n",
    "because the target joint velocities can be chosen so that movement to\n",
    "the next milestone does not require stopping. Trapezoidal velocity\n",
    "profiles and cubic curves are the most convenient forms for allowing\n",
    "waypoint velocities. To do so, the specified velocities should be\n",
    "incorporated as boundary conditions when solving for the form of the\n",
    "interpolation profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cartesian commands\n",
    "\n",
    "More sophisticated multi-axis motor controllers, such as those found in\n",
    "industrial robots, may mix joint-space and Cartesian commands\n",

    "Cartesian motion queue\n",
    "functionality is useful to guide tools along workspace paths, while\n",
    "joint-space waypoints are superior for moving quickly between\n",
    "configurations. A motion queue can construct Cartesian interpolation\n",
    "profiles, with two caveats.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, IK solutions along the interpolation profiles should be verified\n",
    "to exist when given a Cartesian Go-To command. If no solution exists,\n",
    "the command should return an error code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, during execution, an IK solver must be used to find the joint\n",
    "space configuration and velocity for the interpolated Cartesian target\n",
    "position. These values will be then used as setpoints to the low level\n",
    "controller. Alternatively, operational space control methods can be used\n",
    "for direct Cartesian control without the use of an IK solver using only\n",
    "Jacobian information. Operational space control will be briefly covered\n",
    "below. In either case, error codes may be invoked during execution when\n",
    "no IK solution exists, the robot hits joint limits, or passes near\n",
    "singularities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interruption\n",
    "\n",
    "Interruption is a helpful feature for motion queues when the robot may\n",
    "need to react to unexpected conditions. As an example, a stop and reset\n",
    "may be triggered when the robot mistakenly drops an object during a\n",
    "transfer task.\n",
    "\n",
    "To stop movement an unspecified time, it is a simple matter to clear the\n",
    "remainder of the queue once a robot reaches a stopped waypoint. But if\n",
    "the robot should be stopped during the middle of movement, some care\n",
    "must be taken. One option could be to execute a maximal braking\n",
    "trajectory, which slows down each joint as quickly as possible. The\n",
    "issue with this approach is that the robot will likely drift from the\n",
    "desired trajectory because each joint is slowed at a different rate,\n",
    "which may cause collisions. An alternative is just to slow the robot\n",
    "down along its current trajectory by reducing the path speed to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another mode of interruption is to instantaneously start moving to a new\n",
    "waypoint, clearing the remainder of the queue. This was illustrated for\n",
    "the simple piecewise linear interpolation profile in\n",
    "[Fig. 3](#fig:PiecewiseLinearInterpolation). However, to avoid sudden\n",
    "changes of velocity, the interpolation profile used in the queue should\n",
    "support nonzero initial velocities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most sophisticated mode of interruption would to allow unlimited\n",
    "editing of the motion queue at any point in time. Providing such\n",
    "functionality usually requires a fair amount of bookkeeping on the\n",
    "controller, and hence is rarely implemented for most industrial robots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State machines\n",
    "\n",
    "For many tasks, the robot controller should perform some notion of\n",
    "*switching* between discrete modes of operation. For example, to\n",
    "implement Cartesian commands and braking trajectories, the controller\n",
    "must activate different functions, accept different input, and report\n",
    "different status codes depending on which mode it is in. This type of\n",

    "--------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Although PID control is sometimes adequate for strong motors or\n",
    "lightweight robots, it is not sufficient to achieve the level of\n",
    "trajectory tracking accuracy demanded by industrial applications. There\n",
    "are three reasons for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Gravity biases the torques needed to keep the robot upright. A PID\n",
    "    controller compensates for gravity via the integral term, but the\n",
    "    amount of compensation required is highly configuration dependent.\n",
    "    In fact, if a joint axis flips orientation, the torque needed to\n",
    "    resist a given load will need to entirely reverse sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  The effective inertia of the subchain at each joint is highly\n",
    "    dependent on its configuration. For example, if an arm is\n",
    "    outstretched, the shoulder joint will need to apply stiffer torques\n",
    "    to track a trajectory than if it is tucked.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  At high speed, the Coriolis term becomes significant, causing\n",
    "    biasing torques that must be compensated.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, many industrial robots use model-based techniques to\n",
    "calculate *feedforward torques* that reflect some of the biases coming\n",
    "from the robot's dynamics. The simplest form of feedforward torque\n",
    "computation is *gravity compensation*. In this mode of operation, the\n",

    "for regulating the errors between the true $G(q)$ and the estimate\n",

    "Operational space control\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often desired to control the end effector of an articulated robot\n",
    "more accurately in Cartesian space than in joint space. *Operational\n",
    "space control* is a method for doing so without the use of inverse\n",
    "kinematics. Another application of operational space control is to apply\n",
    "or respond to forces in Cartesian space, which is a key step in *force\n",
    "control* and *impedance control*. Properly applying these concepts\n",
    "requires a deep understanding of how to transform forces and robot\n",
    "dynamics between joint space and the operational space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, operational space is synonymous with the definition of task space\n",
    "that we have used throughout this course. Specifically, a task space\n",
    "$x = \\phi(q)$ is defined with the Jacobian\n",
    "$J(q) = \\frac{\\partial \\phi}{\\partial q}(q)$. As usual, the task space\n",

    "the more typical $x = f(q)$ so as to not conflict with the $f(x,u)$\n",
    "notation used for a dynamic system.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical derivation\n",
    "\n",
    "To get a sense for this approach, let us suppose that the robot's\n",
    "dynamics are first-order and velocity controlled. In other words, we\n",
    "wish to determine a control $u$ such that $\\dot{q} = u$. Let $x_D(t)$ be\n",

    "feedback position gain $K_P$ and the feedforward velocity\n",

    "use the Jacobian relationship $\\dot{x} = J(q)\\dot{q}$. Using the\n",

    "stationary, then given any starting configuration, this will drive the\n",
    "task coordinate $x$ to converge toward $x_D$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we could also use the Jacobian transpose rule\n",
    "$\\dot{q} = J(q)^T \\dot{x}_{cmd}$ and derive a stable controller in task\n",
    "space. To see this, observe that the dynamics of the task space error\n",

    "Hypothesizing the Lyapunov function $V(e) = \\frac{1}{2} e^T K_P e$, we\n",

    "observation that $\\frac{\\partial V}{\\partial e}(e) = K_P e$, observe\n",
    "that $\\dot{V}(e) = -e^T K_P J J^T K_P e$. If $J$ and $K_P$ are\n",

    "The result of operational space control (with $K_P$, $K_D$ diagonal) is\n",

    "linear in Cartesian space. If same step change was achieved by a change\n",
    "in configuration setpoint to a PID controller, the system response would\n",
    "be nonlinear.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there are a number of difficulties in implementing operational\n",
    "space control. First, it is important not to let the Jacobian become\n",
    "singular, because the effective inertia will become infinite. Even if it\n",
    "is near singular, the inversion involved in computing the effective\n",
    "inertia matrix will cause unacceptably large torques to be computed.\n",
    "Second, if the configuration has met one or more joint limits, some\n",
    "directions in the task space will become uncontrollable. In light of\n",
    "these issues achieving stable operational control often requires a\n",
    "significant amount of tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Force and impedance control\n",
    "\n",
    "Using operational space control and a force sensor, it is possible to\n",
    "obtain a number of interesting behaviors, including Cartesian force\n",
    "control where the end effector can apply a specified force, or \"zero\n",
    "gravity mode\" where the end effector behaves like a free-floating rigid\n",
    "body. These two behaviors are known, respectively, as *force control*\n",
    "and *impedance control*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In both cases, force sensing can be accomplished with a sensing element\n",
    "(a force/torque sensor) on the end effector, or indirectly via joint\n",
    "torque sensors. Joint torque sensing is generally less accurate at\n",
    "estimating the forces applied to the end effector due to loss of\n",
    "observability at singularities, but does not require external equipment.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be noted that force sensors are prone to noise, requires\n",
    "frequent recalibration, and runs a risk of irreparable damage to force\n",
    "sensors by overloading. Moreover, to obtain stable control loops a great\n",
    "deal of tuning, calibration, and optimization of sensor signal filters,\n",
    "the force sensor's inertial parameters, the robot's inertial parameters,\n",
    "and time delays. Hence, implementing force and impedance control\n",
    "successfully in practice requires substantial amounts of effort from\n",
    "even experienced control engineers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Force control is the process of regulating a force applied to the\n",
    "environment in closed-loop fashion. To illustrate how this might works,\n",
    "consider a 1-D task space $x = \\phi(q)$ denoting the end effector\n",
    "position along some axis. Assume that the robot is contacting the\n",
    "environment at the initial configuration $q_0$, and that we would like\n",
    "to apply a desired force $f_D$ at the end effector. The basic idea of\n",
    "force control is to sense the external force $f_{ext}$ and if it is too\n",
    "high, to reduce $x$, and if is too low, to increase $x$. Although this\n",
    "is conceptually simple, the implementation is not!\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issues to address are that 1) the force sensor does not\n",
    "directly report $f_{ext}$ but rather a combination of external force,\n",
    "gravity, inertial forces due to end-effector acceleration, and noise, 2)\n",
    "it is not clear how much to increase or reduce $x$ to obtain a desired\n",
    "change in force, and 3) those changes in $x$ need to be converted into\n",
    "joint-level commands. Operational control handles issue 3, but not 1 or\n",
    "2. To extract the external forces from the sensed forces, the operation\n",
    "of a force sensor should be modeled in detail. Accelerations will be\n",
    "observed as force spikes in the sensed force signal, and changes in the\n",
    "end effector orientation will be observed as a bias in the force signal:\n",
    "$$f_{sensed} = f_{ext} + f_{gravity} + f_{inertial}\n",
    "\\label{eq:ForceSensor}$$ The best way to estimate the external force is\n",
    "to model the force of gravity and inertia on the sensor by estimating\n",
    "the sensor's orientation and acceleration and subtracting their sum from\n",
    "the sensed force. Orientation and acceleration must be estimated from\n",
    "the robot's encoders or an inertial measurement unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we need some way to link the deviation of force $f_D - f_{ext}$\n",
    "and the control signal given to the operational space controller\n",
    "(usually $\\ddot{x}_{cmd}$ or if joint torque control is available, the\n",
