    "Once you graduate from university and start in the robotics workforce, you will be exposed to a massively different world than you've encountered in your classes, educational competitions like FIRST robotics, team projects in student organizations, and even research projects at well-reknowned labs. You may be thinking, \"Well, I've worked on team class projects, so I know pretty much how this will go.  Some people pull their weight, some slack off, but, in the end, everything will go ok for our final report.  The workforce will be pretty much like that.\"  (Oh, how I wish to be so young and naive again!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't underestimate it: the scale of the engineering effort (and its impact) in the enterprise setting will be larger than anything else you have experienced at university, the impact of the \"soft skills\" like teamwork and communication will be much higher, and the quality standards for your technical contributions will be higher too.  It is not uncommon to feel some culture shock during this transition.  Hopefully you will have had some summer internships doing real R&D to help you prepare for this experience.  Or, you may be lucky enough to participate in one of the few university labs that engages in system engineering at a reasonable scale -- and by \"reasonable\" I mean 10+ simultaneous developers on one project.  Even if you're a student with a 4.0 GPA, if you can't adapt to the complexities of systems engineering, you might end up a perpetual junior engineer bumbling your way around an organization with no hope for career advancement.\n",

    "Real-world robotics engineering requires working on large and diverse teams over long periods of time.  A good engineer is grounded in 1) the theory governing component algorithms, 2) system integration and development practices, and 3) effective communication skills to document, justify, and advocate for their work.  Teams of engineers also need managers, and a good manager is grounded in 4) logical and organized thought about the system at appropriate abstraction levels, 5) project management skills to plan, assign, and track development progress, and 6) people skills to motivate the engineering team and convey the vision and progress to upper-level management.  Both classes of employees should also bring a sense of personal investment in the project so that they stay enthusiastic as setbacks are encountered, the project scope changes, and personnel changes occur.  Although a lot of these aspects cannot be taught outside of self-help books, we will be able to provide some degree of training in items 2), 3), 4), and 5) in this book.\n",

We can only scratch the surface of this material, as there have been many wonderful books written about systems engineering, software engineering, organizational strategy, and organizational psychology.  People can be quite opinionated and passionate about these topics, and we lack hard data exploring which methods are more successful than others, so it's best not to delve too deep into any one philosophy.  Nevertheless, this high-level summary should be help the aspiring robotics engineer (and engineering manager) predict the terminology, best practices, and pain points they are expected to encounter in their future career."

    "\n",
    "It is hard to define precisely what a \"system\" means, but for the most part we can settle on a somewhat vague meaning: a **system** is an artifact composed of multiple interacting **components** that is engineered for a defined **purpose**.  Often (but not always) these components correspond to different physical units, computational devices, or pieces of code. The most critical aspect of this definition is that the components themselves are engineered to produce specified function by interacting with other components within the system.  We can system as a network of components interacting through edges (a system diagram) and reason about operations and information flow at a more abstract level than thinking about the details of how each component is implemented.  At an organizational level, we can also think about projects in terms of a timeline of implementing components, measuring their performance, or replacing old implementations with new ones. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Abstraction** is the key tool we use in system engineering to manage complexity.  Abstraction is also hammered home in typical computer science curricula due to the complexity of large software projects.  Its purpose is a *cognitive* one: human brains are simply incapable of reasoning holistically about thousands or millions of lines of computer code interacting with controllers, power electronics, motors, and mechanisms.  Instead, for our own benefit we must break the system into smaller components, each of which fulfills a specific function.  These \"functions\" are our mental model of how each component behaves or *should behave*.   The mechanism by which we achieve abstraction is called **encapsulation**, which means hiding details of the implementation from the external user.  We should not need to know all the details by which a motion planner works in order to use it, e.g., if it uses RRT, PRM, trajectory optimization, etc.  We just need to know the inputs, the outputs, and its expected peformance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that in a sufficiently complex system, the components are usually also systems themselves, built out of sub-components!  You may ask, why do we choose one level of abstraction over another?  One could define a car as a system of tens of thousands of parts down to the last bolt, but for most purposes that is not as useful of an abstraction as defining a car as a body, frame, engine, wheels, steering, electrical system, and passenger compartment.  Useful for whom?  Well, the company management, engineers, factory workers, parts suppliers, certification agencies, repair shops, and customers would tend to think of different parts of the vehicle that way.  Indeed, the theory, expertise, design, tooling, and operation of each of these components is specialized for their specific function.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a systems engineer, you may welcome abstraction at times, but at others, you may struggle against it. Some possible pitfalls include:\n",
    "- Compatibility conflicts\n",
    "- Incorrect abstractions\n",
    "- Leaky abstractions\n",
    "- Overzealous abstractions\n",
    "- Bad abstractions\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering again the car example, if you are designing a sleek and streamlined body with decorative elements that you know will sell to customers, you may run into a struggle with the engine designer who can no longer fit a sufficiently beefy engine to give the customers the horsepower they desire.  This is a *compatibility conflict* which needs clever engineering or strong management to resolve.  (If you are Ferrari, your boss tells you to quiet down and design the body around the engine!) \n",
    "\n",
    "An *incorrect abstraction* is one in which one's mental model of the system may not be satisfied by the implementation. As a real-world example, my lab struggled with an issue for several days during development for the Amazon Picking Challenge.  We found that when we were testing at certain times of the day, our robot would start acting strange and the picking performance would drop precipitously.  Then we'd test again, and everything would work fine.  The culprit?  The Intel RealSense cameras we had at the time would normally report RGBD data at 30 frames per second (fps) in good lighting, but then silently drop to 15 fps in poor lighting.  Because the students on the team would work long into the night, they set up the perception system to work appropriately with the lower frame rate.  But at the higher frame rate, some network buffers were being filled with too RGBD images, and so the perception system was processing stale data from multiple seconds in the past.  The issue here was that our working mental model of the camera was a device that provided data at a consistent rate, and this abstraction was not incorrect. Perhaps we should have read the documentation better or constructed more thorough [unit tests](#unit-and-system-testing)! \n",
    "\n",
    "*Leaky abstractions* are a similar concept that can cause all sorts of frustration. In the Amazon Picking Challenge, the variable frame rate of the camera caused *side-effects* that we did not account for, as we did not carefully design the perception system in mind with all the details of the ROS communication system.  This is because the publish-subscribe abstraction used by ROS is, coarsely speaking, \"a publisher sends a message and immediately the subscriber(s) get it\".  In order to find the issue the developer needs to know more about networking than was promised -- specifically ROS queues and the slow receiver problem.  Once we found the culprit, the fix was easy (shortening the queues to only provide the latest data), but placing blame on the right component was tricky.   (We'll see more about how to [assign blame to components later](#analysis).)\n",
    "\n",
    "An *overzealous abstraction* occurs when a component is designed to encapsulate too much functionality.  Developers of other components would like to interact with a finer level of control over its internal functions.  For example, developers of industrial robots often provide a \"go-to\" subroutine that does not terminate until the robot arrives at its destination (or encounters a fault).  This would not be acceptable if you wished to build a collision avoidance system that could stop the robot mid-motion if an obstacle were detected in the robot's path.  A similar concept is the *bad abstraction*, in which a component tries to do a collection of things whose grouping is poorly rationalized or cognitively complex.  Bad abstractions often come from a combination of overzealous encapsulation and changing requirements. As new use cases arise, the developer adds more and more configuration parameters to customize how the component functions, leading to an unwieldy, confusing set of inputs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An aspect of abstraction that is somewhat unique to robotics is that many **upstream components must model downstream components** in order to function properly. For example, state estimators, object trackers, and planners need a dynamics model to predict how the system moves.  If the movement mechanisms or low-level controllers grow in complexity, the dynamics become more complex, necessitating more complex models.  Similarly, increased sensor capabilities usually lead to greater complexity in observation models used in state estimation or [active sensing](PlanningWithDynamicsAndUncertainty.ipynb#active-sensing).  For this reason, as we seek to improve component performance, we usually pay the price in terms of model complexity."

    "\n",
    "The most important part of organizing a team of engineers is to build a shared *mental model* of what that function that system should perform, what components the system will consist of, and how those components will operate.  There are many ways to build such mental models, listed in order of formality:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. *Background knowledge* (a.k.a. book learning): all the topics studied in courses, books, and academic papers.  After you have graduated from a robotics program, you should generally know the functions of forward and inverse kinematics, motion planning, trajectory optimization, Kalman filters, deep neural networks, etc.\n",
    "2. *Experiential knowledge*: information that an individual gathers from interacting with the system and its components.\n",
    "3. *Community knowledge*: information scraped from web forums.  This includes the use of ChatGPT and other AI tools, which are trained on such community  information. (Such information is often of dubious validity)\n",
    "4. *Tribal knowledge* (a.k.a. institutional memory): information passed between team members and held within individuals' memory. \n",
    "5. *Textual documentation*: design documents, code comments and documentation, technical manuals, presentations shared amongst the organization.\n",
    "6. *System diagrams*: control flow diagrams, computation graphs, and state machines.\n",
    "7. *System specifications*: application programming interfaces (APIs), interface definition languages (IDLs), behavior trees (BTs), and modeling languages, e.g., Universal Modeling Language (UML).\n",
    "\n",
    "As a general rule, as a project or organization matures, information should **flow down** this list toward formal models (documentation, diagrams, and specifications).  As the formality of such information grows, it becomes more precise, interpretable, widely disseminated, and longer-lasting.  The tradeoff is that turning information from mental information to formal knowledge takes time and effort.  Keeping formal knowledge up-to-date is also more time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rookie mistakes include keeping information too long in informal form, or letting implementations drift from the specifications.  When these happen, it leads to confusion amongst the development team and/or external users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, it is important to understand that these specifications are meant for humans so that we can understand and design the system more effectively.  The only complete specification of a system is the code and hardware itself.  But the developer who begins working by reading every line of code is a rare bird.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Describing connectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "A common form of system specification is a description of its components and how they are interconnected.  These specifications often take the form of graphs / network diagrams that visually depict components as nodes and connections as unidirectional or bidirectional edges.  You have probably seen these before, in the form of **control flow diagrams**, **neural network architectures** **computation graphs**.  In these diagrams all of the items exist through time, and connections may be either synchronous (transfers occuring at every time step) or asynchronous (triggered by a component's request).  Connections usually refer to some data flowing over a communication channel or function invokation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important aspect of such diagrams are:\n",
    "-  Defining what is **not** connected.  If a connection does not exist, then it should be understood that information cannot flow directly from one component to another.  For example, at a glance, we should be able to see that Team A will need to coordinate their API with Team B (A and B being connected) but not Team C (A and C not being ocnnected).  We should also be able to see that component X produces data Y and Z, but not W.  If a new component needs W, then it certainly can't get it from component X.  (A fully-connected diagram is nearly useless.)\n",
    "- Human interpretability. A diagram of hundreds of nodes may be useful to describe what is known to the computer, but is too conceptually difficult or time-consuming for all but the most dedicated engineers to understand. At a glance, we begin to become overwhelmed at around 10-30 nodes.  Consider using a hierarchical decomposition into subsystems if your diagram begins to look too complex.  Use colors or line styles to indicates groups of nodes / edges with similar function (and don't forget to include a legend).\n",
    "- Precise identifiers.  The names associated to nodes should also correspond to identifiers in your effort. For example, they may identify HW or SW modules, teams, or vendors. \n",
    "- Relevant annotations.  Ideally, a diagram should give the reader hints about important design characteristics about your system. For a neural network, we may be interested in its size (number of parameters), so the shape of various layers would be a useful annotation.  For a computation graph, we may be interested in the data types, rates, and bandwidth of communication channels. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Control flow diagrams** are one form of connectivity diagram describing the overall function of a system or subsystem's controller. They may also be used to describe perception pipelines.  Input signals are passed in (usually from the left) and the system transforms them in a series of elementary functions to produce output signals (usually on the right).  Edges are directed and the direction indicates inputs/outputs to a block.  The system may also update internal variables, indicated as backward loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that all operations of the control flow diagram are intended to \"activate\" instantaneously in a temporally continuous manner.  That is, every block's output changes whenever its input changes. The software implementation of a control flow diagram can be thought of as a series of function calls from left to right, with the outputs of intermediate functions fed as inputs to other functions.  Essentially, the diagram can be thought of as one big nested function call.\n",

    "**Neural network architecture** diagrams are very similar.  The diagram gives a series of transformation functions (layers) that are sequentially executed at inference time (i.e., whenever the network is queried). The connectivity also dictates how training proceeds by backpropagation.  Since the architecture defines one big function call, its gradient is determined backwards via the chain rule.  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Computation graphs** are used frequently in system integration to describe the connectivity of software modules. Each node is a software process or thread executing a real-time loop, and all nodes operate in parallel. Edges indicate potential data flow, e.g., through publish-subscribe over a topic, remote procedure call, or any other [inter-process communication](SystemIntegration.ipynb#inter-process-communication) mechanism.

    "#### Describing temporal activities and behavior\n",
    "\n",
    "Most robot systems switch between different behavioral modes with well-defined switching conditions. The most classic diagram for describing the temporal evolution of these behavioral modes is a **state machine** (aka flowchart).  A state machine is especially important for designing reliable systems when describing error conditions and recovery behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a state machine, each node (state) identifies a behavior and each edge identifies a transition condition.  A single behavior can be activated at once, beginning from some initial (or entry) state. When the condition identified by an outgoing edge is met, then the active behavior switches to the indicated new behavior.  As an example, see the following state machine describing a *guarded move*, which moves a robot until its target is reached or a force threshold is achieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: figure on a guarded move with force control\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that a state machine diagram leaves the details of the behavior unspecified, so it is important to provide other descriptions of the behavior modes unless the behavior is absolutely trivial (such as \"idle\").  The transition conditions may also be rather complex to specify within an annotation, so additional documentation may be needed for these as well. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Behavior trees** are another temporal behavior specification gaining in popularity. The idea of a behavior tree is to decompose a complex behavior into hierarchical and sequential steps. A tree's nodes can themselves be trees, leading to a compositional data structure that can make it easy to chain together long sequences of behaviors.  Behavior trees generate behavior by by traversing the tree from the root downwards upon each cycle (called a *tick*).  When a node is ticked, it may trigger a behavior, or for some of its children to also be ticked depending on its function.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically three types of nodes in a behavior tree:\n",
    "- Control (non-leaf) nodes, which select which of their children to execute, if any, on each cycle.\n",
    "- Behavior (leaf) nodes, which perform some function to drive the robot each cycle.\n",
    "- Condition (leaf) nodes, which perform a test.\n",
    "\n",
    "A node also returns to its parent upon a tick that the underlying behavior *succeeds*, *fails*, or *continues*.  The parent control node may change internal state depending on this signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, a sequential control node has a series of child nodes, each of which is ticked in sequence.  When the first child succeeds, the active child proceeds to the second node until it succeeds, etc.  When the sequence completes, it loops back to the start.  If any child fails, the whole sequence fails.  This allows for long chains of activities to be arranged very easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional behaviors can also be implemented using a sequential node, by placing the condition node as the first child and the behavior node as the second child.  If the condition passes, then the behavior is run. If it fails, then the sequential node stops and the behavior is not executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: figure on behavior tree for a guarded move with force control\n",
    "\n",
    "Behavior trees and state machines *are logically equivalent* in that any state machine can be implemented via a behavior tree and vice versa.  However, some types of behavior are easier to implement via a behavior tree and others are easier to implement via a state machine.  The optimal choice for a project depends on personal preference as well as team experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Hierarchical diagrams\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy is typically necessary to document a system when it becomes complex enough to appear overwhelming.  Both connectivity diagrams and temporal diagrams can be hierarchical in nature. We have already seen that behavior trees are naturally hierarchical, but other forms of diagrams can be made hierarchical as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a hierarchical control flow or computation graph, a macro-node indicates an abstraction of a group of related nodes.  For example, if a subsystem launches some set of tightly-connected nodes (e.g., a hardware unit and its drivers, or a perception pipeline), this would be a good candidate for a hierarchical representation. The macro-node may also have its own subsystem diagram.  The inputs to the macro-node must be the union of connections from any node outside the group to any node within the group. Likewise, its outputs must be the union of connections from any node within the group to any node outside the group.  Within-group connections are ignored within the system diagram. For this reason, it is helpful for system architects to group together nodes with many within-group connections but few between-group connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "In a hierarchical state machine, a group of states that are downstream of a single entry state can be considered a macro-state.  For example, a calibration sequence may have several steps executed one-by-one, with errors handled by some recovery mechanism.  The outer-level diagram can have a state called \"Calibration\" with transitions upon \"Calibration complete\" and \"Error occurred\".  In the outer-level diagram, all states in the group are replaced by the macro-state, and all conditions leading to the entry state are replaced by conditions leading to the macro-state.  Each transition condition that exits the node group is replaced by a transition condition at the outer level.  Each of these transitions corresponds with an specific inner state being reached *and* a trigger of the exit transition condition, so in our calibration example, if errors could occur at different inner steps, the outer-level diagram can handle them differently. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a system evolves, it is important to maintain logical consistency between a subsystem implementation, its subsystem diagram, and the outer diagram.  Inconsistencies can lead to confusion especially amongst larger team, so some system engineering tools provide processes to automatically keep track of changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Separation of concerns \n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of abstraction is that an engineer will need to use a component in various ways during development and evaluation.  Defining a clean internal abstraction of the core functionality will facilitate development speed and reduce the risk of bugs.  There are a number of typical design patterns that are helpful for designing clean abstractions for robot systems.  These design patterns help enforce *separation of concerns* where the implementation of a unit is separate from its connectivity, tuning, testing, and online use.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Thin wrapper pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The **thin wrapper** is arguably the most useful and common design pattern to know in system engineering.  Its purpose is to separate out:\n",
    "1. A component's core functionality  -- that which is essential, algorithmically complex, shareable, and long-lasting.\n",
    "2. Interoperability functionality -- that which connects the core functionality to other aspects of the system, the development process, and external users. This \"layer\" is upgraded often, transient, and/or messy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale is that code written for interoperability is going to change frequently after the core functionality is finished. So, if the interoperability code is *thin* and *separate* from the core code, then it can change quickly as project requirements change without polluting or inadvertently altering the core.  Multiple wrappers can also exist simultaneously, and many times the developer of the wrapper is a different person than the developer of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Study: Developing, integrating, and testing a complex algorithm**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider developing an object tracking algorithm, with the core code written in Python. The algorithm developer could embed ROS code via ``rospy`` to subscribe to an image stream and then publish outputs via a custom ROS type for the object tracks. During development time, this was tested on a ``rosbag`` dataset and everything worked perfectly.  Now, during deployment time, let's suppose that the image topic changed.  Or, it was decided to use ROS 2 rather than ROS 1.  *Should I just hack the code and fix it?*  Next, the boss is asking to plot some tracking results, using OpenCV overlays.  *Hmm, maybe I could hack the code to output the tracking video?  Or maybe write a new script start up the rosbag, read the ROS 2 outputs, and then generate the tracking video?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ugh, no, no and no.  Unfortunately, 95% of developers in robotics  would just do that. But that's because they are badly trained -- they didn't read this book. Please don't join the boneheaded crowd! Let's see how this looks with thin wrapper paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To adopt a thin wrapper paradigm, the core functionality is kept as simple and agnostic to the interconnection layer as possible -- say, a Python function that takes in a Numpy array, the previous tracks, and returns the new tracks.  Next, in a separate file, the ROS 2 interoperability is defined (say, ``ros2_tracker.py``) by subscribing to the input, performing necessary image conversions, calling the function, and then performing necessary output conversions.  Keep this simple and short.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what about plotting test results?  Set up a separate test script (say, `video_test_tracker.py`) to load the test video, call the function, and plot the results.  Again, the plotting code is kept as thin as possible, and separated from the core functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Case Study: Deploying ML models**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at a second example for machine learning workflows, which are becoming increasingly common.  A growing number of junior engineers learn how to write a script to train and test a model in Jupyter notebook, but shockingly few have every considered deployment. In the standard robot learning workflow, you will need to create a model architecture, load a dataset, train the weights, save and load weights, qualitatively examine results, run quantitative tests, tune hyperparameters, and deploy multiple model versions.  *You've done the training and testing in a Jupyter notebook, so what's next?  Copy your code and model to the robot?*\n",
    "\n",
    "Ugh, again.  What happens when you need to test different architectures, or dataset integrations?  Legions of students and junior engineers have wasted days or weeks before a deadline repeatedly commenting out and then un-commenting code for individual runs.  The better way to do this is to separate 1) core functionality of the model, 2) model weights and hyperparameters, and 3) training and testing scripts.  The code that implements core functionality can therefore remain mostly static and transferrable through the version control system (e.g., Git), whereas weights and hyperparameters are treated like data, and scripts are individual, transient things -- an example may be bundled with the core code, but each person may adopt their own implementation that lives on their personal workstation.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Facade pattern\n",
    "\n",
    "The facade pattern is another extremely useful concept that helps developers enforce abstraction and simplify development as a complex system grows. \n",
    "A facade is a layer (e.g., API) that collects the complex inner workings of a system into a single, relatively simple entry point.  For example, rather than a robot arm exposing all details of several servomotor's current control, initialization, filtering, thermal managment, and gravity compensation, the user-level API may elect to expose joint position control, Cartesian control, and joint position sensing for simplicity.  Usually, the facade implementation contains very little logic, and instead acts to convert and route data between the user's calls and the underlying component implementations.  A facade is a helpful place to provide documentation, enforce conventions, unit conversions, and synchronization between heterogeneous parts.\n",

    "A common facade in robotics helps end users treat all the parts of a robot as a unified system.  A *robot facade* should provide convenient access to movement, sensors, and overall status so that higher level behaviors can be developed more easily.  Suppose that we have built a robot with a robot arm, gripper, and camera.  Communicating with the arm and gripper may require access to several ROS topics, while the camera might have another API, such as OpenCV, Intel Realsense SDK, or Zed SDK.  A robot facade may provide a Python API that looks like the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Robot:\n",
    "    def initialize(self) -> bool:\n",
    "        \"\"\"Call this first. If False is returned, an error occurred and no subsequent\n",

    "\n",
    "Note that the above facade implements a model of the robot such that its movements are executed sequentially -- the movement target cannot be changed once the motion has begun, and the progress of the motion cannot be monitored.  This may be the most convenient model for some applications, such as industrial pick and place, but it would be inappropriate for applications involving closed-loop feedback control.  It is the job of the facade implementer to design the abstraction in a way that best serves the end user.  If the user is not served well, the facade will fail to be adopted, or the implementation will be worked around with messy code that breaks the abstraction.\n",

    "A third useful facade is to treat a complex perception system as a unit.  In the standard sense-plan-act framework, the underlying perception system may be very complex, using dozens of algorithms each of which may maintain internal state, perform dynamic calibration, operate on a GPU, etc. --- but the ultimate role of the system to pass perception objects to the planner.  A facade implementation of this abstraction would define a \"knolewdge\" layer that the planner can query to retrieve the best estimate of the robot's localization, maps, object detections, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of an autonomous vehicle, the facade may look something like this:\n",

    "The complexity of the underlying implementation, such as whether lanes are determined through a predefined roadgraph or dynamically determined through vision, and the rates at which each component is run, is abstracted away so that the user can focus on just the output.  The facade layer is also useful for testing different system architectures and hardware configurations, because it enforces a certain output convention that allows for apples to apples comparisons."

    "### Reliability and redundancy\n",
    "\n",
    "Given 𝑛 components in sequence, any one of which may fail independently with probability $\\epsilon$, the probability that any one of them fails is $1−(1−\\epsilon)^𝑛$\n",
    "- Example: $\\epsilon$=0.05, 𝑛=5 => 23% probability of failure\n",
    "- Example: $\\epsilon$=0.01, 𝑛=10 => 9% probability of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "Given 𝑚 (redundant) components in parallel, the probability that all of them fails is $\\epsilon^𝑚$\n",
    "- Example: $\\epsilon$=0.05, 𝑚=3 => 0.01% probability of failure\n",
    "- Example: $\\epsilon$=0.5, 𝑚=5=> 3% probability of failure\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO figure\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, it should be cautioned not to directly use these equations to predict true system failure probabilities, because component failures are often *not independent*.  Suppose that in the spirit of redundancy, we have outfitted a drone with 3 inertial measurement units (IMUs) so that we have two backups in case any one fails.  Each one may fail with a probability $<$ 1%, so we should expect our system to fail with probability $<$ 0.0001%, right?  Well, if the IMUs rely on GPS readings for global positioning or on Earth's magnetic field for a compass heading, all three IMUs may be susceptible to GPS denial (indoor environments, tall buildings, or jamming), GPS blackouts, and magnetic interference.  Or, if the drone gets jerked around rapidly, accelerometers may saturate leading to degradation of accuracy.  So, a developer should watch out for *common causes* of simultaneous failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, these equations give a compelling rationale for three high-level goals in system development:\n",
    "1. Improve the reliability of individual components(reduce $\\epsilon$).\n",
    "2. Minimize long chains of dependent components (minimize $n$).\n",
    "3. Implement redundant approaches for the same task (maximize $m$).\n",
    "\n",
    "You may ask, what strategies should a development team pursue to accomplish each of these goals?  Addressing the first is fairly straightforward: find the \"weakest links\" in a sequence, and get your domain specialists to improve robustness (\"harden\") those components.  [Unit testing](#unit-testing) is an important practice to adopt here. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address the second goal, we find that in robotics it is often impossible to reduce chains of dependencies past perception, planning, and control steps.  There have been research efforts to perform \"end-to-end\" learning that circumvent intermediate steps, but these approahes have not yet reached the reliability and customizability of the classical sense-plan-act framework.  On the other hand, we have seen major advances in perception where classical pipelines that have involved long chains of processing steps (e.g., from pixels to features, from features to parts, from parts to objects) have been replaced by deep neural networks.  Also, complex planning pipelines that involve mission planning logic, task sequencing, subgoal definition, and low-level planning can be replaced with unified components, such as [task-and-motion planning](AdvancedTopicsInPlanning.ipynb#task-and-motion-planning).  It can also be helpful for an upstream planner to define a scoring function that rates terminal states rather than a single goal for a downstream planner.  This is because an upstream planner can make a mistake in assigning an infeasible goal, and the downstream planner would be unable to find a solution.  If, instead, the upstream planner assigns scores for possible goals (penalizing unfavorable goals) then the downstream planner has more options: it could find a less favorable but feasible solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Approaches for the third goal depend on whether the component's failures are a) reported by the component, b) due to random phenomena, such as sensor noise or a mechanical device wearing out, or c) systematic errors, such as sensor artifacts or an algorithm failing to find a valid solution.  In cases a) and b) the *replication* approach simply adds duplicate units.  If failures are reported (case a), then it is a simple matter of switching to a backup when a primary unit fails.  If they are not detectable, then you will need a mechanism to estimate which units are failing, such as taking the *median* of 3 or more sensors or adding a separate *anomaly detector*.  The median approach is an effective way of handling malfunctioning sensors which may report extreme values, since the median of 3 sensors will be one of the value from the remaining 2 functioning sensors.  In case c), replication is insufficient since each unit will fail in the same way, i.e., each unit's errors would be affected by a common cause.  Instead, you should implement alternative approaches that *fail in different conditions* than the primary approach.  For example, for high-reliability scenarios like autonomous driving it is a good idea to consider implementing multiple redundant planners (e.g., generate-and-score, graph-search, sampling-based planners, and trajectory optimization) which are run simultaneously on different CPU cores.  The resulting paths can be then rated and the best one chosen for execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "In reality, development will be continual both within a phase and between phases.  Within a phase, there will inevitably be iterative evaluation and design as components are tested and refined, and when interacting components are upgraded.   There also will be continual work between phases. (... more specifically, between phases I-III, since most robotics companies never get to a product!)  Requirements will change, integration challenges will kick problems back to the component teams, data gathered from integration testing will go back to tuning and machine learning, acceptance testing may require repeating the planning phase, etc. So, even though you might worry as mechanical engineer that your job will no longer be needed after the start of Phase II, in reality you are likely to be called upon throughout the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, in a later section we will describe the concept of [vertical development](#horizontal-vs-vertical-development) in which teams are created early in the development process to solve Phase III problems.  This is a very good idea, as it can be hard to predict all of the integration problems that will be met.  User interface development is also often an afterthought in many engineering projects, but getting early results from user interface testing is another very good idea.  The end user might find something confusing, or not so useful, or might even be satisfied with a partial product!  Having this information at hand can drastically shape the landscape of development priorities and make the difference between success and failure within the development budget and timeline.\n"

    "### Project management\n",
    "\n",
    "Project management is a \"soft skill\" that comes in handy both in industry as well as in academia.  When proposing a project, whether in the form of a pitch meeting or a grant proposal, the person who holds the purse strings is not only going to want to hear your idea, but also evidence to support confidence that the project will be managed well.  This requires giving a plan about how you will manage four key resources: *time*, *money*, *people*, and *existing infrastructure*. Now, delivering on your plan also requires day-to-day management skills.  All that is written on this topic could fill volumes, but we will touch on a few key points in project management here. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project planning\n",
    "\n",
    "The first stage of project management is *project planning*.  In your plan, you should articulate both a *vision* for what you hope to achieve as well as *activities* that you hope will get you there.  The vision is a broad statement about what you hope to achieve by the end of the project.  The activities are specific steps that, if successfully executed, will achieve the vision.  Usually these activities are organized around *deliverables*, *milestones*, *phases*, or *aims*.  Regardless of what you call them, it is very important for these activities to be articulated in a way that builds confidence in your approach and begins to organize your team's use of key resources.  *SMART goals* are a helpful tool for articulating these activities.  The acronym SMART refers to goals that are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Specific*: the goal should specify what is to be achieved, who will be responsible to achieve it, and generally how it will be achieved.  \n",
    "- *Measurable*: there should be a success/fail criterion that specifies when the goal is actually achieved.\n",
    "- *Achievable*: the goal should be realistic with the constraints of available resources.\n",
    "- *Relevant*: the goal should contribute to the overall vision of the project.  If it is not obvious, you should articulate how it contributes. \n",
    "- *Time-bound*: provide an achievable and relevant deadline for achieving the goal. \n",
    "\n",
    "An additional (and often underappreciated) consideration is whether your activities are *complete* and *complementary*. Completeness means that the vision will be achieved if each of your activities are finished successfully.  Complementary means that your activities build on one another and do not duplicate effort.  If you fail to articulate a complete set of activities, your audience is left to hope that your team will somehow figure something out to fill the gaps without requesting additional resources.  If you fail to articulate a complementary set of activities, it sounds like you are wasting resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Don't underestimate how hard this is; it takes practice, experience, and deep thought to write a good plan. I have seen senior managers and tenured faculty struggle through it, resulting in projects being shuttered and grants being rejected.  Some typical pitfalls are poorly articulated metrics or evaluation plans, omission of underappreciated steps (of bridging components, integration efforts, or human-machine interfaces, typically), and under-resourcing or unrealistic resourcing (e.g., we will spend $200,000 on a robot and then hire an engineer who will program the application in 6 months).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Scheduling\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important part of project planning is *scheduling*.  For small projects you can provide estimates based on your prior experience, but as projects grow in complexity and duration, you will need some tools to help understand how people, time, and equipment are allocated to the tasks that make up your activities.  One key tool for planning your project schedule is a *Gantt chart*.  These are fairly straightforward charts with a timeline, broken into periods (e.g., days, weeks, months, quarters), on the X axis and tasks on the Y axis.  Task dependencies are indicated with an arrow from the completion of one task to the start of another.  This might sound obvious, but it is essential that any task that depends on the completion of another starts later in the timeline!\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: Gantt chart example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important part of scheduling is assigning tasks to time periods.  In doing so, you ought to estimate how long each task will take assuming a given level of staffing, including the optimistic (best-case), realistic (average case), and pessimistic (worst-case) duration.  The optimism of your scheduling should be chosen to correspond with your project sponsor's tolerance of time and budget overruns.  Each task with a dependency should be scheduled after the end of the dependent tasks.  The time spacing between the end of one task and the beginning of another, if any, is a *margin of error* that your project may tolerate.\n",
    "\n",
    "A natural question is how long might the entire project may take?  To figure this out, we need to determine the *critical path* through the schedule. \n",
    "\n",
    "<a id=\"critical-path\"></a>\n",
    "> **Critical path**: the sequence of dependent tasks in a plan whose total duration is the longest.\n",
    "\n",
    "The critical path can be determined by setting up the tasks as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) and finding the longest (weighted) path.  (Although an algorithm can be used to solve the problem, it is usually easy enough to find the critical path by manual inspection).  Any tasks on the critical path must be completed on schedule in order for the project to be completed on time, whereas non-critical tasks are often allowed some margin of error.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that as stated in a traditional form, critical path analysis does not take into account resource limits (except for time).  Limited resources can significantly affect the schedule of a project.  Imagine that everything must be done by one person: there's only so much time in the day, so you cannot execute multiple tasks in parallel unless your effort on each task is less than 100%.  To come up with a resource-limited schedule, you will need to ensure that throughout the timeline, each simultaneous task does not exceed the level of your available capacity.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Handling risk\n",
    "\n",
    "Every plan has some risks associated with it: the likelihood that everything goes perfectly according to plan is quite low!  You may be building some untested technology, the implementation of a component might be harder than it looks, end-user testing may reveal that you haven't planned to implement a necessary feature, personnel might quit, IT infrastructure can crash, your whole country may suffer from geopolitical destabilization... We can't eliminate all sources of risk during project management, but we can mitigate their impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step to risk management is to anticipate parts of the plan that are especially risky.  Steps that involve complex implementation, untested technology, end-user evaluation, and regulator certification typically require some degree of scrutiny.  Once sources of risk have been identified, a project manager should consider creative solutions to *de-risk* the plan. \n",
    "\n",
    "De-risking is industry jargon for reducing the likelihood or the impact of risk on a plan.  There are a few ways to de-risk a plan:\n",
    "- Create a *contingency plan* which takes effect if the risky condition is met.  For example, if algorithm A isn't performing well by date D, begin implementation of backup algorithm B.\n",
    "- Implement a *parallel* backup plan to be conducted in conjunction with the main plain, and switch over if the risky condition is met.  The main team will implement algorithm A, the backup team will implement B, and you will decide which one to use at date D.\n",
    "- *Iterative development* that makes progress toward project goals using multiple design-prototype-evaluate cycles.  After each evaluation, lessons learned should be incorporated into the next prototype.\n",
    "- Because the likelihood of risk is also hard to estimate in advance, it may be helpful to develop *risk evaluation* steps into the plan which will help better estimate the likelihood and severity of risks.  [Unit testing](#Unit-testing), early [system testing](#System-testing), and [headroom analysis](#Headroom) are various strategies to help evaluate risk during the development process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design documents and project tracking\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming you have followed these guidelines and won approval, congratulations! Your project now needs to start. The first task is for you to get your team aligned on the specific technical steps that need to be executed to complete a project goal.  The first place to start is usually a *requirements document*, which declares technical objectives in terms of specific, measurable aspects of the deliverable.  You will then (or simultaneously) write a *design document* that outlines the steps and timeframe for achieving those objectives.\n",

    "### Horizontal vs vertical development\n",
    "\n",
    "When developing a product there will often be teams that focus on specific components, as well as teams that integrate multiple components to fulfill specific system functions.  These are, respectively, known as **horizontals** and **verticals**.  This terminology follows the notion of a \"tech stack\" with high-level, slow components on top and low-level, fast components on the bottom (see the connection to [hierarchical architectures](AnatomyOfARobot.ipynb)?)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Horizontal development**: development that focuses on a technical component.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Vertical development**: development that focuses on integrating technical components into an overall system function or behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "TODO: figure showing horizontal / vertical matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineers on a horizontal team will focus on refining a component's performance.  For example, an object detection team would be a horizontal one and would focus on improving detection accuracy.  They will also work with members of intersecting vertical teams to ensure that their component works to implement the vertical function.  These will typically be subject-matter specialists with intimate knowledge of the mechanical, electrical, algorithmic, and/or computational aspects of that component.  Their performance metrics will typically involve [unit testing](#unit-and-system-testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "Engineers on a vertical team will focus on expanding the range of functions of the system, or its operational domain.  For example, in an autonomous driving company a lane changing team would be focused on producing high quality driving behavior when the vehicle needs to perform a lane change.  They will often have specialists in multiple relevant horizontal teams who will work with those horizontal teams to ensure that the system function can be implemented.  For example, lane changing may require specialized agent trajectory prediction and motion planning functions, so working closely with those teams should be a high priority for this vertical.  In contrast, an object detection horizontal team may not need to be closely involved, since lane changing does not typically require any different object detection capabilities compared to normal driving.  A vertical team's performance metrics will typically involve [system testing](#unit-and-system-testing).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a common pitfall, especially in smaller organizations, to assign effort only to horizontal components or only to vertical ones.  Without verticals, the effort on components may not be well-targeted to produce the desired functions of the system, which leads to last-minute scrambling as product deadlines grow near.  Without horizontals, development is slowed down by a lack of coherence and expertise in technical components.  You may end up with a mess of code with multiple implementations of motion planners, object detectors, etc. with different APIs, coding conventions, and quality standards.  In a real-world example of this, I participated on a DARPA Robotics Challenge team that was vertically oriented.  The competition asked teams to develop a robot to complete 8 search-and-rescue tasks, and the theory was to have a lot of professors working on the same team, each of whom had expertise on each task.  My students and I were on the ladder climbing team, another professor's lab would address valve turning, another's would address driving, etc.  As it turns out, the lack of coordination between task subteams was a big handicap. Although we scored quite well on my event during the semifinals, the team as a whole didn't make it to the finals..."

    "### Taking technologies to market\n",
    "\n",
    "A concept that has gained popularity through its development at NASA and then later adopted by the U.S. Department of Defense, the EU, and the Industrial Standards Organization (ISO) is the notion of [Technology Readiness Levels](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_readiness_level) (TRLs).  \n",
    "\n",
    "> **Technical readiness level (TRL)**: a rating scale from 1-9 designating the maturity level of a piece of technology, ranging from the basic theoretical principles observed (TRL 1) to fully proven deployments in the operational environment (TRL 9).\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, university research operates at TRLs 1-4, at which point a technology is validated in a lab environment.  The transition from TRL 4-6 is often accomplished in industry or applied research labs.  The last stages of maturing a technology from TRL 7-9 involves product development and refinement, and is almost always accomplished in industry or government labs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intermediate stages of development, roughly TRL 4-7, are known as the technological *Valley of Death*.  The reason for this is that many promising technologies are mature enough to be demonstrated in the lab, but the amount of investment required to turn them into a reliable product (known as *technology translation*) is often underestimated.  For example, costs for safety certification of medical devices can run into the tens or hundreds of millions of dollars.  This phase is also accompanied by a shift in personnel from the original inventors of the early-stage technology to a development team, and this shift may come at a loss of momentum, enthusiasm, technical expertise, or project management expertise.  It may be unwise to ask a professor to start a company! \n",
    "\n",
    "Another serious risk for any translational endeavor is improper *product-market fit*, since we technology developers are always enthusiastic about our technology, which leads us to have \"blinders on\" that prevent us from predicting whether the market (i.e., consumers) will appreciate our product.  Robotics is especially susceptible to this kind of failure.  The remedy to this tendency is to perform early *market analysis* by speaking to potential consumers, whether this would be factory owners who might purchase an intelligent automation device, or the general public who might buy a home robot.  The results may be eye-opening or even damning to your idea.  You may get the best results by switching development priorities, e.g., you find that a new factory robot needs to identify items in clear plastic bags.   Or, you may realize that your dream is doomed, e.g., you find that the number of acceptable dishes dropped a home robot is less than 1 per month, but your best lab tests place your algorithm at 5 drops per hour.  Convincing your market that their needs are irrelevant is the definition of foolishness.  You might be able to convince an investor to give you money for your idea, in the long run, your customers will decide whether your business succeeds or not!"

    "**System testing** (aka *integration testing*) evaluates whether the entire system performs its specified function according to key performance objectives.  This is of course the end-goal of developing a system, but the integration process is expensive and takes a very long time. So, system engineering typically involves a large amount of **unit testing**, which evaluates whether an individual component performs its specified function.\n",

    "If designed correctly, unit tests help developers align their efforts toward relevant goals, project managers will have a better sense of priorities for allocating effort, and the whole team develops progressively greater confidence that the system will be ready for its ultimate tests. However, unit testing takes time and can even waste development effort if the metrics are not chosen wisely to align with system-level goals, or the test cases are not chosen properly.\n"

For a replay, we would simply record the output of the object detector running on some video data.  For a simulation, we would run our test by running the simulation and the object detector on the images generated by simulation.  Finally, for a faked simulation, we would skip generating images in simulation, and instead build a fake object detector that reads objects directly from the simulation's objects."

This process is known as *headroom analysis*.  The reason why headroom analysis is employed is to help inform development priorities.  Suppose component A takes input from component B and has a performance metric M, and we are deciding whether to invest in an alternative implementation A'.  However, the inputs to A' would require us to modify component B to B' or add an additional transformation layer C that would process B's outputs.  Instead of implementing these changes (and then potentially having to roll them back if A' doesn't work as well as desired), we can first perform headroom analysis by defining mocks for A' simulating an ideal inputs according to a hypothetical implementation of B'. We can also simplify our implementation of A' to avoid challenging or pathological inputs.  If the metric result M' in headroom analysis does not improve significantly on M, then it is not worth investing in implementing full versions of A' and B'."

Simply put, weights $w_1,\\ldots,w_k$ are defined and the aggregate metric is just a weighted sum: $\\sum_{i=1}^k w_i f_i$.  Care must be taken in choosing the weights so that metrics with different units are placed on a comparable spectrum.

    "Because robot behavior depends on the conditions (scenario, environment, objects) in which it is tested, the value we obtain from a metric evaluation is highly dependent on how these conditions are chosen during the evaluation process.  The aggregate metric that we compute is a *sample* from the range of possible conditions, and so we must be conscious of how we select those conditions.  We can influence the result of a metric in three ways: first by changing the *evaluation domain*, second by changing the *evaluation distribution* over that domain, and third by changing the *evaluation thoroughness*.  If we choose a narrow domain, e.g., picking and placing brightly colored cubes on a table, then our metric (say, 95% success rate) may not generalize to other scenarios, e.g., unloading dishes from a dishwasher.  The distribution of our tests also has a major effect on our numbers.  An autonomous vehicle can work extremely well in highway or suburban streets, but terribly badly in urban streets.  So, if we test our vehicle 99% of the time in easy cases, our company's numbers will look much better. Finally, if we stop testing early because we got the result that we wanted, or perform *cherry-picking* by ignoring or redoing tests that failed, we can also artificially inflate our numbers.  \n",

Instead, real development processes and evaluation processes happen in an interleaved, continuous manner.  This leads to a challenging question: *when do we use the results from testing to start debugging a component or even redesigning the system*?  I find that junior students and developers will often be ready to scrap their work and start over after observing a single failure, but that failure might have just been a fluke.  A more extensive evaluation would lead to more conclusive findings, and therefore more confidence in our response.  But evaluation takes time, resources, and imposes risks of damage, so for expediency's sake we should prefer that evaluations be short. \n",

Does the problem require a localized fix to a single component or a more global redesign?  When multiple problems pop up, how do we triage the response to address the most critical problems first?  Better debugging practices, such as extensive logging, regression testing, A/B testing, and simulation testing will provide more information to help developers better assign blame and determine an accurate scope for the fix.\n"

Speed or precision?  Reliability or cost?  Weight or battery usage?  Although in theory we always seek the optimal decision, real life is all about tradeoffs.  How then, is one to decide upon choosing the \"best\" implementation?  This is not an easy question -- each stakeholder may have a different set of preferences.  These preferences may also change over time. \n",

In this analysis, our implementations are different points $x$ in a *design space* $X$, and for each such implementation, we can evaluate all of our metrics.  We note here that $X$ is quite abstract, and does not have to correspond to a numerical space.  What is important is that the evaluation metrics can be run on any design $x$ to produce an objective vector $\\mathbf{f}(x) = (f_1(x),\\ldots,f_k(x))$ where there are $k$ different metrics.\n",

This gives us an ordering that can be used to compare designs in a potentially sensible way.  However, when comparing two designs $x$ and $x^\\prime$, the \"better\" one may depend on the choice of weights!  So who is to say that the weights were chosen sensibly?  For example, if one metric were in units of millimeters and the other were in units of radians squared per second squared, how should we weight between them?  Moreover, should we always prefer the tradeoff between two metrics to be linear?  If two people on your team disagree about the best weighting, you could be stuck arguing for days!\n",

Specifically, $x$ Pareto dominates $x^\\prime$ if there exists an $i \\in \\{ 1,\\ldots,k \\}$ such that $f_i(x) > f_i(x^\\prime)$, and moreover, for all $i, $f_i(x) \\geq f_i(x^\\prime)$. \n",

You can think of these as \"plausibly optimal designs\", which could be the best depending on your weighting and monotonic transforms of your metrics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Practically speaking, this means that dominated designs should be eliminated, while some Pareto optimal designs should be retained for deeper consideration or future development.  If your metric space is large, though, there may be a huge number of designs that are Pareto optimal, and it may not be practical to compare all of them -- for example, in charts that you present to management.  It is typically a good idea to choose a few diverse designs with a focus on ones that do relatively well on \"preferred\" metrics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Uncertainty\n",
    "\n",
    "Uncertainty is a common concern in any evaluation including multi-objective ones.  Given a design's performance on a small test set, it is unclear how well the design will perform upon deployment. Moreover, the continued development of a design means that its metrics will evolve, perhaps performing better in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to capture uncertainty in multiobjective analysis, confidence intervals are a common tool.  If each performance metric $f_i(x)$ is associated with lower and upper bounds $\\underline{f}_i(x), \\overline{f}_i(x)$ such that the true metric value is contained within the interval ($f_i(x) \\in [\\underline{f}_i(x),\\overline{f}_i(x)]$), then comparisons in the multiobjective metric space can be performed on the boxes that contain the actual performance.  Each design $x$ now is associated with a confidence box $[\\underline{f}_1(x),\\overline{f}_1(x)] \\times \\cdots \\times [\\underline{f}_k(x),\\overline{f}_k(x)]$.  A design $x^\\prime$ is confidently Pareto dominated if its performance upper bound is at or below the lower bound of some other design $x$. Specifically, $\\overline{f}_i(x^\\prime) \\leq \\underline{f}_i(x)$ for all $i$ and $\\overline{f}_i(x^\\prime) < \\underline{f}_i(x)$ for some $i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important usage of confidence intervals is headroom analysis when deciding whether to continue down an extended development pathway.  Suppose that our current design $x$ is underperforming (say, it is dominated by $x^\\prime$, as is typical with early-stage implementations), and we perform a headroom analysis to determine $x$'s best possible performance under optimal circumstances.  If the highest performing point in the confidence box is dominated by the current performance of $x^\\prime$, then it is strictly not worthwhile to continue developing our design.  On the other hand, if $x^\\prime$ currently dominates $x$, but the headroom analysis suggests one or more dimensions in which $x$ might outperform $x^\\prime$, then it may be worthwhile to continue down the pathway.  On the other hand, a headroom analysis on $x^\\prime$ might determine that it might reach even higher potential performance limits -- and choosing which one to devote manpower to is an exercise in strategic judgement.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "What if your system is Pareto dominated by the competition? Does the team iterate more so that it beats the competition on the existing metrics?  Or do you find new metrics in which it does better (such as cost or performance in a niche domain) and then market your system accordingly?  These are the problems frequently faced by executives and managers of R&D teams.  \n"

    "\n",
    "You couldn't be more wrong!\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizing code well is the single most important imperative of software engineering.  Developers spend more time searching through and reading code than actually writing it. Some sources say the ratio is 10:1!  Code must be iteratively debugged, improved upon, and maintained, and so you and others on your team will need to be able to browse files, read code, identify problem areas, and modify significant parts of your code throughout the lifetime of your project.  Choosing sensible, disciplined organizational practices will accelerate development for everyone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some tips to help you start organizing your projects better:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Separation of concerns*: maintain separation between code for algorithms, integration wrappers, settings, models, data, logs, executors, tests, and setup. These can be in different files, different folders, and respect naming conventions that help your teammates (and future you) identify the location and purpose of code.\n",
    "- *Descriptive naming*: make sure your files, functions, and variables are named in a way that tells the reader most of what they need to know about their meaning.  Don't use generic labels like \"myFunction3\" or \"the_var\": tell us something about how these should be used.  Group code that performs similar functionality into similarly-named files, or place them in the same folder, module, or package.  Follow naming conventions to make your code cleaner and avoid confusion amongst your team.  For example, in Python methods and variables that are \"private\", i.e., not useful for the user of a class, should be prefixed with an underscore (_).  Using this convention tells a reader of your code that only you, the implementer, should bother trying to understand the purpose of this item.\n",
    "- *Dont repeat yourself* (DRY). This is the principle that exactly one version of a function, parameter, or piece of data should exist in your codebase. If you feel the urge to copy your code into a new file (like \"my_function_version2.py\") to change a parameter, **STOP YOURSELF**! Instead, make it that parameter a function parameter, or a configuration variable.  Let the caller of the function decide which version to use.  In some ways, DRY is the starting point to all software engineering.  Well-organized projects will have minimal duplication of code.  However, in some complex cases it makes more sense to break DRY to duplicate-and-modify.  The main reasons to duplicate-and-modify would be that the number of configuration parameters is growing too unwieldy (e.g., a function with 10+ parameters) or that a unified function would be so complex that maintenance would be a nightmare.\n",
    "- *Hard-coding vs soft-coding*. Ah, the embarrassing practice of hard coding... we don't usually admit it, but we all do it from time to time.  This is generally considered poor practice if you have any intent of sharing your code.   It is far preferable to use \"soft-coding\" practices, such as configuration files, command-line arguments, or parameter servers. If you absolutely must hard-code anything, please, please put these values as constants at the top of your file, with a descriptive name and a comment about how they are used.\n",
    "- *Keep the codebase up-to-date*. Remove old code when you have a better alternative, don't just comment it out. We don't want to see things like myfunction-v2.py, myfunction-v2last.py, myfunction-v2lastlast.py.  Use [Git](#software-management-skills) or some other versioning system to keep track of old versions.\n",
    "- *Document your code*. Use comments, readme files, documentation systems, or design documents to help explain how your code can be used and how it works.  The very act of explaining your code pushes you through a mental exercise that leads you to more logical and organized decisions.  To write well-organized code, you must shift your mental paradigm from \"I need to get this code to work\" to \"how does anyone else use this code?\"\n",
    "- *Convention vs configuration*. Any significant project will develop components that accept many parameters.  Any user of those components will need to specify those parameters somehow, and it takes time to figure out how the parameters affect functioning.  There are two design philosophies about how this should be done.  The *convention-over-configuration* philosophy is to provide \"sensible defaults\" and only require the user to configure a parameter explicitly if they desire less-common functionality.  The *configuration-over-convention* philosophy asks the user to explicitly set parameters rather than accept defaults.  The first philosophy argues that convention facilitates rapid prototyping and lessens a novice user's cognitive load, since they do not need to understand the breadth and nuances of functionality provided by the component.  The second philosophy argues that implicit parameter setting runs the risk of the user accepting a mistaken default setting, because it encourages lazy thinking.  In my experience, robotics is better suited for the convention-over-configuration approach because our systems are so complex that it is nearly impossible for a single person to understand every nuance of every component.  When writing your component with a convention-over-configuration philosophy in mind, it is important to follow the \"principle of least astonishment\", which is that by default your component should behave how most users would expect it to behave rather than be surprised."

    "6. Scale-up: the product grows from a few lab systems into hundreds or thousands of sellable units.\n",
    "7. Feature changes: product requirement changes demand changes and additions to the system.\n",
    "8. Support: deployed systems must be supported through maintenance, troubleshooting, and software updates.\n",
    "9. Extension: the initial system is evolved into new products.\n",
    "\n",
    "These phases are also consistent between each technical sub-area represented in a project (e.g., hardware, sensing, perception, planning, learning).  \n",

    "2. Software R&D: develop the proof of concept algorithms and machine learning models on lab systems.\n",
    "3. Software architecture: begins the transition from research to product development, developing tooling and disciplined development practices.\n",
    "4. Software engineering: refine the software for robustness and performance.\n",
    "5. Test operations: formalize instrumentation, data logging, and reporting procedures.\n",

So I assume that most people reading this book have their interests piqued about research (phase 1 and 2).   While this may be the right area of focus for the field right now, in order for robotics to grow and mature as an industry, it needs to move beyond research into production-quality engineering.  In the long-run a healthy company will employ at least 10x the number of engineers as compared to researchers.  The typical roboticist's attraction towards open-ended research also brings another source of friction as the company grows: researchers that thrive in an early-stage creative and experimental environment tend to feel stifled by the relatively mundane process of production engineering.  Keeping those researchers onboard and happy requires continuous appetite for long-term innovation, which can be especially difficult for smaller companies without established revenue streams.  For some perspective, keep in mind that R&D is always an expenditure -- more specifically, it comes with the expectation of returns on investment (ROI).
